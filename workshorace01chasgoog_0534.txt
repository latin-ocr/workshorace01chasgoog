an ‘argentei-ius? and he employed-a ‘praeca’ See S. i. 6. 86, n. ‘ Certe
lare ’ is a common phrase, as Bentley himself has shown, as in Virgil (Georg-
iv. 155), “Et patriam solae et certos novere penates ”3 and (Aen. vi. 673),
“ Nulli certa domus ; lucis habitamus opacis.'' Compare Epp. i. 15. 28.
“ Scurra vagus non qui eertum praesepe teneret.” ·

61. Non sune credere Meum] ‘Sane' is not commonly used in negativo
sentences· It is an adverb of emphasis. As to ‘ benign& see above, v. 16,
and on the subjunctive ·’ neget,' compare S. ii. 6. 31. ‘⁴ What, he deny me ’ἐ ”

65. tunicato serata popello] To be without the toga in the streets was not
considered respectable. It was eonfined to the lowest sort of pcople‚ which
is expressed by the diminutive ‘ popello.’ This word is used only here and
by Persius (iv. 15). ‘ Semta ’ signifies small wareS, being derived from the
Greek γρύτη. As to ‘occupat,' see C. ii. 12. 28, n. ’

67. noercenaria vinela,] The bonds (that is, the occupations) of buying and
selling. Mena offers these as his excuse for not having waitcd upon Philip-
pus in the morning, at his ‘ salutati0‚' as, aster his attention of the previous
day, he would have felt bound to do if 110 had had time.

71. Post nonam venies ,·] See above, v, 47, n., and C. i. 1. 20, n.

72. dicenda tacenda Iocutus] This is a familiar adaptation of the Greek
ῥητὸν ἅῤῥητόν τ’ ἔπος (Soph. Oed. Col. 1001), which was a conventional
phrase. It means all manner of things, Persius (iv. 5) has “ dicenda taeen-
da'que calles.’' Virgil (Aen. ix. 595), “digna atque indigna relatu Vocife-
rans.” Horace means that Volteius was placed at his ease by his host, and,
being a simple man, talkcd of what came uppermost without waiting to see
isit was out of season or not. ‘Dimittere’ was a word of politeness used
among equals, as above, v. 18.

73. Hic ubi saepe] After he had broken the ice, Volteius was easily per·
suaded to repeat his visits, till at last 110 became an established guest and a
daily attendant at the 11011 man’s morning receptionS, till, on one occasion,
he was invited to accompany Philippus to his country-seat in the Sabine
country, during the ‘feriae Latinae.' This festival was of the highest an-
tiquity. Its proper name was Latiar. The holidays lasted six days, during
which all manner of festivities went on, and business was suspended. They
were ‘feriae conceptivae,’ that is, they were annual, but not held always at
the same season, which is what Horace means by calling them ‘indictae.'
The magistrates appointed the time of their celebration.

79. dum requiem, dum visus] Philippus, tired with his work, refreshed him· ·

self by getting amusement at other people's expense. He gave the man a
sum equivalent to about εΕ 60 of English money, and offered to leud him as
much more. ·

84. vineta crepat πασας] So Cicero says (Ad Att. ix. 12), “ Mera scelera
loquuntur.'’ (Ib. 13.) “ Dolabella suis literis merum bellum loquitur.”
(iv. 7.) “ Chaerippus mera monstra nuntiaret.”

87. Spem maurita aeglea] See C. iii. l. 30, n.

91. Durus -attentnsqneJ Philippus means that he appears to be too hard-
working and anxious about his affairs. Compare S. ii. 6. 82, “Asper et
attentus uaesitis ”5 and Epp! i. 16. 70, “ sine paseat durus aretque.”

92. Ρ me miserum,] Gellius (xi. 6) says, respeeting oaths of this sort,
that women never swore by Hercules, nor men by Castor, but both men and
women would swear by the temple of Pollux, ‘Aedepol‚' and this, he says
on the authority of Varro, was only adopted by men in later times, whereas
it had always been used by women, who got it from the Eleusinian mys-
teries.

94. Quod te per Genium] See Epp. ii. 1. 144. This use of the relative
ffid' in entreaties is common, as in Vir-gil (Aen. vi. 363), 81111 Terence

ἱ dr. i. 5. 54). It was customary for slaves to pray to their masters by

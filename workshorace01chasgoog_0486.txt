theg as men of sound mind to be marked with a white mark, or ( as nuscund)
wi a black ’.ἱ ’ ‘ Sanin ' is a contraction of ‘sanine' ‘ Quorsum abeant ’Ξ ’
‘what is to become of them? are they to be marked, &c. ’.ἱ ’

248. Ludere par impar-,l A game fit only for children, in which one per-
son guessed whether the number of things another person held in his hand

was odd or even.' The Greeks had· the same gamo, and called it ἁρπάζειν.
Stertinius goes on to speak of the man of pleasurc, whose madness is no less
than that of the covetouS, the ambitious, or the spendthrift. With the last hc
is closelv allied. ‘

250. ratio esse evim-etl See above, v. 225. He says, ‘⁴ If reason convinces
you that all these symptoms of madness are no worse than whining after
women, is it not better to repent and lay asidc such things ’ἒ ”

251. trimus Quale prius] Such a game as you used to play at formerly,
when you were but three years old.

254. Mutatus Rolemon 9] Polemon was a youth given ‘to pleasures and bad

school, but was so struck with what he heard, that, having gone in a thought·
less profligate, he came out serious and quite conver-ted. He succeeded Xeno-
crates at the head of the Academy (B. c.3l5). Xenocrates himself, whose

urity of life and sobriety of character are referred to in the word ‘ impransi,’
hccame the head of the Platonic school on the resignation of Speusippus
(B. 01339). He was the disciple of Plato, and accompanied him on his
trave s. .

255. Fasciolas, cubitat, focalia,] These are all articles of dress, worn only
by women, or by men who took great care of their person. ‘ Fasciola’ was
a bandage for the lege, ⁴ cubital ' a sleeve for the arm, ‘focale ' a bandage for
the throat. ‘Impransus' stands for ‘sobrius,’ because it was not usual for
abstemious men to take the midday meal (‘ prandium ³). ‘Furtim' is a
happy touch of Horace’s. It expresses the shame of the young man, and his
instinctive reverence -for the philosopher and the place he was in, better than
many sentences could have done. ‘ correptus ' means ‘ arrested, conscience-
smitten. ·

258. Por-riqis irato prtem} The caprices of a spoilt child are no worse than
those of lovers squabbling and making it up, again.

259. Sume, catelle!] Such diminutives were expressions of endearment.
There is a collection of such in a scene of Plautus (Asin. iii. 3. 76) :

“ Dic igitur mc passerculum, gallinam, coturnicem,

d Agnellum, haedillum me tuum dic esse vel vitellum ”3
an ver. 103 :

“ Dic igitur me anaticulam, columbam, vel catellum,
Hirundiuem, monedulam, passerculum putillum.’'

260. aqit ubi secum] With such a scene as this the Eunuchus of Terence
openS, and a good deal is taken word for word from that scene. The lover's
indecision is re resented elsewhere, in Epod. xi. 19, sqq.

270. nihilo phas explicet] ‘ Explico ' signifies to gain a point or serve a pur-
pose. There is a like use of this word in Caesar (B. G. viii. 4) ε “ Explican-
dae rei frumentariae causa.’' It is ‘also used in a peculiar sense in C. iv. 9.
44, where see note.

272. Picenis excerpens semina pomis] The orchards of Picenum, the dis-
trict that lay between the country of the Sabines and the Hadriane, appear to
have been celebrated. In the next Satire (ver. 70) Picenian apples are said
to be superior to those of Tibur, and they are mentioned many years later by
Juvenal (xi. 74). The sport here alluded to is thus explained. Lovers were
went to take the pips of apples between their finger and thumb and shoot
them up to the ceiling, and if they struck it, their wish would be accomplished.
Some such games are common in our own nurseries.

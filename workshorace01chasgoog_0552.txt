19. Scurmr syo ipse mihi, This verb does not occur elsewhere. The pnr-
ticiple is used in the next pistle (v. 2). Aristippus is supposed ω party
the blow (⁴ eludere‚’ a metaphor taken from the gladiatdrs) of Diogenes by
admitting, for the sake of argument, that he acted parasite to a king5 yet 11
was for his own advantage3 whereas the C uic acted parasite 10 the popu-'
lace for their amusement3 he begged their ’rty provisions, and gave them
snat-lin jests in return; and by accepting their alms, he acknowledged
himso their inferior, ant} this though he professed to want nothing of them
91· any 0110 else. ‘ Hoc ’ refers to the remoter object, as in S. ii. 2, where see
11010 011 v. 30.-

20. Equus me portet, alat ren] The Greeks had a proverb} ἵππος με φέρει,
βασιλεύς· ε τρέφει, which words are said to have been first 111101·οᾶ by a
301111101· of hilip of Macedon 10 his mother, who entreated him 10 ask exemp-
tion rom service.

21. Officium facio .·] ‘ Officium ’ is commonly applied 10 attendance on
great people; and the most servile are went to say they are only ‘ doing their
duty’ by their betters. As to ‘ vilia rerum‚' see C. iv. 12. 19, n.; S. ii.

23. Omnis Aristi pum decuit color] See Epp. i. 1. 18, n. ‘ Color’ is ‘ color

· vitae’ (S. ii. 1. 60 , and cortes onds to ‘vitae via’ below (v. 26). We use

‘ complexion’ in the same dou le sense. Horace means that, while Aristip-

is, he is more tho creature of abit than the man ho condemns.

25. duplici-panno] The asceticism of Diogenes was his vsay of carrying
0111 the pnnmple 0 cadumum, wh1ch was a chtef feature m hls toacher-’s sys-
tem. A coame ‘abolla,' a gat-ment thrown loosely over the person, sel-ved
him for his dress, without tunic. He is said to have been the first to wear it
double and to have slept in it, and those who followed him, adopting tho

sam-e practice, were called διπλοείρποι and ἀχίτωνες.. Juvenal says the
Stoics differed from the Cynics only m the use ot the tume (S. xm. 121).

28. celeber-rinna per loca See C. ii. 12. 20, 11. ο
30. Alter Melete textam The purple and wool of Miletus were held in

great esteem by 1110 Greeks. As 1ο ‘chlamys,’ see Epp. i. 6. 40, 11. 11 ap-
pears that -there were several stories ‘egri-ent among the 111ξοί011111 about the

throne of ove und affect the skics), but there is no small ment m pleasing
the great, and it is not everybody who can do it.

36. an cuivis homini] Οὔ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἷς Κόρινθον ἔσθ’ ὁ πλοῦς.-
There are various explanatione given of this proverb, but none cau safely·
be relied upon. ‘ To go 10 Corinth ' involved a difficulty in some sense 01·
other, and so the proverb applies to anythiug that is difficolt and requires

unusual eleamess.

37. Sedit qui timuit] The perfect is'tised as the aorist. ‘He sits idle who
is afraid he shall not succeed. Esto! Be it so (let him pass) : but what of
him who succeeds ’.ἱ Has 110 1101 (10110 mansuily ’.Ρ

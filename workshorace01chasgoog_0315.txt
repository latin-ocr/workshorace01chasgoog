wards, we find him celebrating the annivers of his escape with a sacrifice
to Liber (C. iii. 8. 6), and in the l7th Ode ο this book (v. 32) he speaks of
offering a lamb to Faunus for bis preservation.

The latter part of the Ode is a remarkable instance of Horace's way of
digressing into subjects onl remotely connected with his principal theme.
In speaking of his escape, e is led into a description of the company he
should bave been brought into if he bad been seut so suddenly ιο ffides,
dwelling particularly on Alcaeus and Sappho, and the power os their music
over the spirits of the dead.

Anconem-Whoever planted thee, thou trec, did so on an evil day:
and with impious hand he reared thee. Pax-ridde, guest-murder‚-there is
no crime lie—would not commit. No one can provide against all dangers.
The sailor fears the sea, and nothing else; the soldier fears his enemy alone ;
but death comes often from an unexpected source. How nearly was I sent
ιο the regions below, where all the shades wonder, Cerberus listenS, the
Furiessl are charmed, and the damned suspend their labors, while Sappho
and caeus sing.

1. nefasto] A ‘ dies nefastus ' was roperly one on which, the day bein
dedicated to religion, it was not lawful or the praetor to hold his court. Ovi
thus defines ‘dies fasti' and ‘nefasti' (Fast. i. 47) 2-

“ Ille nefastus erit per uem tria verba silentur ς
Festus erit per qu lege licebit agi '';

where the three words alluded to are said to be ‘do,’ ‘dieo,' ‘addis-ox all of
them familiar and of common occurrence in Roman civil procedure. Hence
the name, which is compounded of ‘ ne ’ and ‘fax-i! And, because no secu·
lar work but what was necessary could prosper on the days called ‘ nefasti,’
all unlucky days came to bear that name as hene3 and the word was thence
applied to express all that was bad, as C. i. 35. 35. The words may be ren·
dered, “he not only planted thee-on an evil day (whoever it was that first-
planted thee), but with impious haud reared thee.'’ The ‘ pagus ' was Man-
dela, in .a valley of the Sabine hills, where Horace had his farm.

6. Frayisse cervicem] This is the ordinary phrase for strangulatiou. It
occurs a ain Epod. iii. 2. 'Jghe force of ‘ penetralia' is, that in the inner
part of t e house the images of the Penates and thc hearth of Vesta were
placed, where, if an here, the person of a guest should be sacred.

10. T ructavit,] his word is sufficient for both substantives. There is no
necessity for supplying ⁴ patravit ' for ⁸ nefas,' as Orelli says. The word
‘tractare ' is widel applied.

11. caducum] his word significa ‘falling’ (iii. 4. 44), ‘fallenss or ‘ready
to fall? More generally the last, as here. Virgil has (Aen. vi. 481) : “ Hic

· multum fleti ad superos belloque caduci Dardanidae ”3 where it means

fzfficnin horam] ‘from hour to bour?

Bosporum] The form of the Greek βοῦς πόρος requires that the name
should be written thus, and not Bosphorum, as it is often spelt. The Plan·-

18, 19. catenas—et Italum Robur ς] ‘ the bonds and the prowess of the Ro-
man? Among the things which the Roman soldier can-ied ιο battle with
him (an axe, a sam ac.) was a chain to secure any prisoner he might take.
To this Horace probably refers in ‘ catenas,' and below in C. iii. 8. 22.

21. fiat-vae reyna Proserpinae] ‘Furvus ' is an old word signifying ‘ dark,'
and is not different from ‘fulvus‚' except in usage. It is much used iu con-

158. uodqaa li ra mereaturetaere‚] There was a mode oft-mk which
vas cal ed ‘ peraes et libr-am? A third person held a pairofscales (‘libra')‚
which the purchaser touched with a piece of money, at the same time laying
his hand on the thing purchased. According to a set form of words he
daimed the thing as his own, and handed the money to the seller as a token
of the sum agreed upon. This form of purchase was called ‘mancipatio'

' The seller was said ‘ mancipio dare' (to which ‘mancipare ' in this place is

equivalent), and the purchaser was said ·‘ mancipio· accipere). A man might
become owner of ‘res mancipii' by having been m possessmn for a certam
time, as much as if he had received it by ‘ mancipatio! Hence ‘ usus ’ is
said ‘ mancipare? because the effect is the same whether a man got his
ownership by ‘ usu& that ie, possession, or by ⁸ mancipatio! ‘ Πίθων· hero

Ariola, see S. i. 5. 1, n. The old Veii had long ceased to exist. It had
been rupiaced (whether on the same site or not is uncertain) by a new· city,
which again fell into ruin in the civil ware. Julius Caesar divided its lande
among his souliers. It appear-S, however, that Augustus restemd it, and
made 1t a municipium. ,

170. qua populus adsita certis Limitibus] ‘ Usque ’ in this verse is an ad-
verb of place, not of time. It means ‘ all the way up to where the poplar
stands? There were many different kinds of private boundarieS, aa, for in-
stance, a stone or an image of the· god TerminuS, with a trec or a clump
planted near it, such as Horace alludes to. A ditch or a hedge‚ a stream or
path, and many other marka, were sufficient to define the limlts of property,
and prevent neighbors fmm quarrelling (‘ vicina refugit jurgia '). ’

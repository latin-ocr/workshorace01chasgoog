¹271? Albuti senis] See S. ii. 1. 48, n. The Scholiasts say the savage old
man used to flog his slaves before they did wmng, “ beemse‚'’ said he,
‘⁶ when you do wrong Ι may not be at leisure to flog you.” ‘ Dido: ‘ to dis-
tribute,' is different in sense and etymology -from ‘ divido! The latter i's
conuecoed with ‘iduo‚' ‘idus' (C.iv. 11. 16, τι), the tormer with ‘ do! ‘Di-
do ’ is commonly used b Lueretius.

68. at simplex Mevius of Navius nothing is known. ‘ Simplex ' is iron-
ical. A story is told by lutat-eh, in his Lite of Julius Cesar (c. 17 3, of Vale-
rius Leo, who put before the dictator some asparagus covered with ointment
instead of oil. Such ‘ simplicit ,⁸ amounting to an indifference to the decen-
cies of life, and a want of oons' eration for others, which some people almost
look upon as a virtue, librace very pmperly deoeribes as a great viee.

such a od dinner that you cannot tell what to eat first. Phorm. ii. 2. 28.

79. tque affiqit hiemo Debauehery not only affects the body, but de-

mses the spirit, and un ts it for the duties of life. The expression ‘affigit
Eume ’ reminds us of the words of David, “ My soal cleaveth to the ground.”
The same sense, though in a different connection, is conveyed by Cicero's
words (De Senect- e. xxi.) : “ Est enim animus caelestis ex altissimo domi-
cilio depressus et quasi demersus in tei-ratu, locum divinae nami-ae aeternita- ·
ti ue conum-ium: which serves also to illustrate ¹ divinae particulam aurae?
T is ex ression may have been taken from some old writer.

2. non secus ia] ‘Non secus ac' is themore usual phrase: but ‘non seeus'
may stand alono.

6. remoto gramine ‘ in a secluded grass spot!

8. Inter-thre nota aler-ni] The cork the ‘amphora' was stamped with·
the name of the consul in whose year it was filled, or a label with that in-

albaque populus] The· Greeks had two names for the poplar,—hevxr'7,
whtch was white, and αἴγειρος, which was .dark. Virgil calls the white

‘bieolon’ ‘Amantss as in C. iii. 16. 10, is used like the Greek φιλοῦσι,
‘ are went! Virgil has a like expression to ‘ hospitalem ' (Georg. iv. 24),
‘¹ obvi ue hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbor.”

11. ‘quo laborat] ‘To what purpose does the flying stream struggle to
haste down its winding chamuel? ' The stream is represented as striving
to hun-y on, in spite of the obstructions offered by its winding banks. As
to ‘trepidam’ see C. ii. 11. 4. Ep . i. 10. 21.

17. Cedat coemptis} Compare ὃ. 14. 21, sqq. of this book.

18. lavat, Horace uses this form, not ‘ lavat!

Ec2du13dpsatur urna] Compare C. iii. 1. 16: “ Omne capax movet urna
nomen.’' The not-ion is that of Fate standing with an um, in which every
man's lot is cast. She shakes it, and he whose lot comes out must die.
Ovid has imitated this passage (Met. x. 32) :--

“ Omnia debemur gobis paullumque morati
Serius aus citius sedem properamus ad unam.
Tendimus huc omnes.
- 28. Exilium] This is put for the place of exile, as (Ov. Fast. vi. 666) :
“ Exilium quodam tempore Tibur erat.” The word is only another form
of ‘ exsidium,’ from ‘ ex-sedeo.’ ‘ cumbae ’ is in the dative case, and is the
form usually found in inscriptions for ‘ cymbae?

 

ODE· IV.

Tms amusing Ode re resents a gentleman in love with his maidservant,
and jocularly consoles ‘ with examples of heroes who had been in the
same condition, and with the assurance that one so faithful must be, like the
slaves of the Homer-ic warriors, the daughter of a royal house. The name
Xanthias must be fictitious, and Phoceus indicates that the erson was also
{gagpffiezuto &geg ξέἓῐξὲῗῃὲῂοᾚὲγαξὲϊῗιξὲἰςέῗξιξιῃιὲἓΡῗιοὲῗῐῗ, ἱέαῐξὲἓᾱῖἓέε htlg
inquire. 'f ere may have been a significance in it which has· passed away,
or never existed but for the understanding of the person addressed‚ and,
perhaps a few intimate friends. Xanthias was a name given to slaveS, like
Geta, SosiuS, &e in the “ Frogs '’ and other plays of Aristophanes. ·

Horace was born B. c. 65, and he wrote this Ode when he was just finishing
his eighth lustro, which v5vould be in December, Β. c. 25.

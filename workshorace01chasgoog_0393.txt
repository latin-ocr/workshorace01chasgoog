Vix-gil (Ecl. i. 45)2 “ Hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille petenti.'’ ’ But
‘ responsum ' is also a technical term for the answer of a jurisconsult to a
client, or a superior to an inferior, as of tho emperor to the governor of a
prggin-‹jgh Fides d Pax] This group occurs nearly in the same combination¹
in C. i. 24. 6. The figures are variously represented on medals, &c- ‘Fi-
des ’ represents honesty‚ good saith, and is called in the above place ‘jus-
titiae soror.' ‘ Honos ’ has nothing to do with what we eall honor in the
sense of honesty (‘ fides ’), but represents Gloria in her good character (for
she had a bad, as vain lory, C. i. 18. 15). ‘ Virtus ’ is most usually repre-
sented in a military c aracter, as Fortitudo; but ‘the name embraced all
moral ‘courage and steadfastness in well-doing, with which military courage
was -closely associated in the mind of a Roman. ‘Pudor‚’ or ‘ pudicitiffi'

60. Copia corna] Copia, whose horn was most properly the symbol of-
Fortune (C. i. 17. 14, n.)‚ but was also given to many other difinities, as'
Fides, Felicitas, Concordia, Honos, ὅσα, was herself represented under the
forms of {abundantia-and Annona, the latter signifying the supply of corn for,

hands (C. ii. 10. 19) ; and it is uncertain whether he did not so appear in the
statue above referred to. ⁴

62. acceptusque novem comenia] See C. iv. 6. 25, n. In some ancient
rilievi and paintin Apollo is represented as seated in the midst of the nine
Muses, who are al paying attention to him.

was attached to im, and is most commonly exhibited in his statues and
other representations. Itis symbolized by the serpent which always attende

65. Si Palatinas vicht aequas areca] See above, v. 33, n. ‘ Felix ' agrees
with ‘ aevum,' and ‘ videt ’ governs ‘ arces,' ‘ rem,’ and ‘ Latium! ‘Ma he
prolon this happy age to another and another lustrum, and ever to a ap-
pier.’ gIt. is common with Horace to put an adjective and its substantive at
the two extremes of a period.

69. Quaeque Aventinam] Diana had a temple on Mons Aventinus and on
Algidus (C. i. 21. 6). From this stanza it has been assumed by some that
the sacred commissionem (the ‘ quindecimviri,' see Introd. and v. 5, n.) took
part in the singing, which is not very probable. Their number, which was
originally two, and was increased to ten about 150 years after the estab-
lgshment of the Republic, was raised to fifteen either by Sulla or Julius

aesar.

have been heard by Jove and all the gods.

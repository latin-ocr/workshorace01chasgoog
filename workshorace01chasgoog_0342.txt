ODE V111.

Tms Ode was composed on the anniversary of IIorace's accident with the
tree (C. ii. 13). Itis addressed to Maecenas, whom. he invites to join him in
celebrating the day, which was the lst of March, B. c. 25, or thereabouts.

Anousxnxr.— Wondercst thou, learned friend, what this sacrifice means
on the Kalentls of March, and Ι a bacheler? On this day I was delivered
from death, and it shall be a holiday. Come, MoecenaS, a 'hundred cups of
my oldest wine to the health of thy friend. Away with anxiety. The Da-
cian has fallen, the Mede is divided against himself, the Cantabrian is in
chains, and the Scythiam has unstrung his bow. Be here the private gentle-
man : never mind the pcople; enjoy thyself and unbcnd.

1. Martiis caelebs] The Matronalia, or feast of married persons in honor

6. dulces epulas} A solemn sacrifice was commonly followed by a ban uet,
at which libations were poured to the god to whom the sacrifice had een
offered.

7. Libero caprum prope funeratus] This last word is not found in any other
writer earlier than Pliny. He and others after him use ‘funero ' for ‘to
bury? Horace here attributes to Liber the deliverance he had before attrib-
uted to Mercu ‚ Faunus, and the Muses, successively (see C. ii. 17. 28, n.).

am hora being lined with pitch or plaster, and the cork bein also covered

‘Amphorae ' is the dative.

12. Consule Tullo] L. Volcatius Tullus was consul 13.c. 66, the year
before Horace was born. This wine, therefore, had probably been in the
amphora upwards of forty years. Sulla once treated the Romans with some

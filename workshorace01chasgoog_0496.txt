sumas. — Boon 11. '481

‘heres ’ or ‘heredes ’ refused it, or had* become disqualified, or had failed to
express his or their intention of accepting it within a time named in the will.
These were called ‘substituti' He might also, if he pleased‚ make provision,
in the case of naming his children his ‘ heredes‚' that, if they died ‘ impuberes,’
another person or persons named by him should get the ‘hereditas' This
was called ‘ pupillaris substitutio‚' and may be referred to by Horace in this
place. ‘ Vacua hereditas ' was a common legal term for an ‘ hereditas ’ made
void by any of the above reasons, or any other.

49. puerum eqerit orem] There is a little moek pathos in this. ‘ Ago?
with the dative, is not a prose construction. See C. ι. 24. 18: “ Nigro com-

P 53. υῗῗιξηίε rapias] ‘ Oculis ' is understood after ‘limis‚’ ‘ with eye as·
kance.' The advice given is, that, if the testator should give the man his will
to read, he should affect indifference and ut it from him, taking care first to
get a side-glauce at its contente, and see i his name appears in the next line

after the testator'S. A will was commonly written on three pages, which ·

were called sever-all ‘prima,’ ‘secuuda‚’ and ‘ima cera,’ ‘cera’ being equiv-
alcnt to ‘ tabula,' the will being usuall written on wax tabletS. The testa-
tor's name appeared in the first line of t e first page, and aster his came those
of the ‘ heredes? In the last page appeared the names of all but the ‘ primi
heredes,' (that ie, the ‘legatarii ' and ‘ substituti,' see note on v. 4e‚) together
with the general provisions of the will. ‘ Solus henes ’ would be called ‘ heres
ex asse ’ς if there were several ‘ herede8,' they would be ‘heres ex dodrante‚'
‘ ex quadmnte,’ etc„ according to the ‹proportion of the estate devised to each,
which was described by the different ivisions of the as. -

55. Plerumque recoctus Scriba ex quinqueviro] ‘Plerumque ’ is used by Hor-
ace in the sense of ‘interdum ’ here and elsewhere. (See A. P. v. 14 and 95.)
The ‘scribae,' of whom an example occurs above (S. i. 5. 35), were clerks in
public officeS. These places were often got by purchase, and the ‘scriba’
received public pay. Nevertheless the ‘ quinqueviri ’ appear from this pas-
sage to have ranked lower than the ‘ scribae.' They were officers appointed
to relieve the other magistrates at night of the charge of the city. These
were the permanent ‘quinqueviri'3 but extraordinary commissione of five
were often appointed for various purposes, (See Dict. Antt.) ‘Recoctus'
seems to mean that he had been a ‘ quinquevir ’ and was now a ‘ scriba‚’ the
‘re' in ‘recoctus’ having no particular force. Teiresias means to say that
coranus, who had got into a situation in which he had aequired a good deal.
of money and some knowledge of business, was too wide awake to be caught
in the snare, saw through the attentions of the fortune-huntcr, and laughed at
him. The ‘ corvus hians ' is perhaps taken from AEsop’s fable of the fex and
crow, co icd b Phaedrus (i. 13). 2

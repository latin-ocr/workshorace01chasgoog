my friends, kinder than a father: despair not, while Teucer is your chief ;

1. Laudabunt] This future is like ‘ scriberis ’ in the last Ode (v. 1),
‘ others shall if they please.’ ‘ Claram ³ means ‘ bright,' with reference to its
cloudless skies. ‘Bimaris ' is an unusual word. It refers to the position
of Corinth, which, standing· at the south of the isthmus, commanded the
shore of the Sinus Corinthiacus, by two long walls reaching from the town
to the sea, and had its eastern port Cenchreae on the Sinus Saronicus

5. Sunt quibus] ‘ There are those who make it the single business of their
lives to tell of chaste Minerva’s city in unbroken song, and to gather a
braneh from every olive to entwine their brow.' A ⁴ perpetuum carmen ’
is a continuous poem, such as an Epic ; and ‘ a braneh from every olive,’ or,
more literally‚ an ‘ olive-braneh from every quarter,’ means that the various
themes connected with the glory of Athens are as olive-treeS, from cach of
which a branch is plueked to bind the poet's brow. The figure is appro-
priate to the locality, where the olive flourished and was sacred to Minerva
(see Herod. v. 8. Soph. Oed. Col. 694, sqq.). We do not know of any poem
or poems to which Horace may have alluded·‚ but Athens furnished subjects
for the ⁴inferior poets of the day.

8. Plurimus] This word'for ‘ plurimi ' standing alone occurs nowhere
else 3 with a substantive it is not uncommon, as ‘ Oleaster plurimus‚’ Georg.
ii. 182. ‘Plurimus aeger‚’ Juv. iii. 232. ‘In honorem,’ for the ablative,
is an unusual construction. But Propertius (iv. 6. 13) sayS, ‘⁴ Caesaris in
nomen ducuntur carmina,” which is an analogous case. See Hom. 11. iv.
51, where Here says : ——-

ἦ τοι ἐμοὶ τρεῖς μὲν πολὺ φίλταταί εἶσι πόληες,

(Αργος τε Σπάρτη τε καὶ εὐρυάγυια Μυκήνη.
She had a celebrated templebetween Argos and Mycenae called the Ἡραῖον.
Homer (Il. ii. 287) calls Argos ἱππόβοτον (‘ aptum equis ⁹), the plain in
which the city was placed being famous for breeding horses.

‘Dites Mycenas ’ is later: Μυκῆναι· τὰς· πολυχρύσους (Soph. Elect. 9).
‘ Opimae Larissae ' is Homeric ; Λάρισσα ἐριβώλαξ (Il. ii. 841). There
were several towns of this name, and it is uncertain which Homer meant,
but probably that in Thessaly. Horace perhaps took his town, wit-h its
epithet, without thinking much where it was. But he may have been at all
these places while he was in Greece. ‘ Patiens ' is the Spartan's historical
character, but also that of Horaee's age. Cicero (Tusc. v. 27) sayS, “ Pueri
Spartiatae non ingemiscunt verberum dolore laniati. Adolescentium reges
Lacedaemone vidimus ipsi, incredibili contentione certantes pugniS, ca cibus,
unguibuS, morsu denique, ut exanimarentur prius quam se victos faterentur.”
‘ Percussit ’ is generally used with the ablative of the instrument or cause.
Standing alone in this way, and in the aoristie perfect, it savors very much of

ἔπληξε, which is used in the same sense.
12. Albunm resonantis] Albunea, one of the Sibyls worshipped at Tibur,
gave her name to a grove and fountain. See Virg. Aen. vii. 81, sqq.
, 13. Tiburni lucus] Tiburnus (or -tus)‚ Catillus, and Coras were the mythi-

, cal founders of Tibur. See Vix-g. Aen. vii. 671. The brothers were wor-

shipped and had a grove there. Tiburnus was the tutelar deity of Tibur, as
Tiberinus was of the river Tiber‚ Auienus of the Anio, &a They are in
fact adjectives. Tibur was famous for its erchards As to ‘uda' see
ρΐὶξὶιὲοξαεξ, n. Close to Tibur there is a fall of the Anio, which explains

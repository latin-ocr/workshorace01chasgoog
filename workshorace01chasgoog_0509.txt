some notion of his own.

10. His ubi sumatis] The narrator is inclined to make a short business of
the viands, but he is brought back to them afterwards. The meat being re·
rnoved, (and though he only mentions one course here, we may gather from
what comes presently that there was no lack of dishes, and therefore, proba-
bly, there were the usual courses‚) a slave, with his clothes well tucked up,
‘succinctus' (see S. 6. 107, 8.), came and wiped the table with a handsome

15. Chium maris expers] Salt-water was mixed with the sweet wines im-
ported from the Greek 18108. Whether Horace refers to this practice, and
means that the wine had not been prepared, and was of inferior qualit , or
whether he means that this pretended Chian had in fact never croese the
8088, 11111 had been concocted at home, is doubted. Orelli and most of the
commentatore adopt the first opinion, after the Scholiasta. I am more in-
clined to the latter. Compare Persius (vi. 39) :

“ Postquam sapere urbi
Cum pipere et palmis venit nostrum hoc maris expers,”

upon the position he tried to maintain.

20. Summus quo The company consisted, as was usual, of nine persons,
who reclined on ree couches, These were arranged so 88 to form three
sides of a square, with the table 18 1110 middle, the fourth end being open,

On each couch were three persons. On the ‘summus,’ Fundanius says 110
himself, ViscuS, and Varius reclined. On the ‘ medius lectus ' were Maecenas
and the two uninvited friends he brought with him, Servilius Balatro, and
Vibidius, On the middle seat of the ‘imus lectus' lay NasidienuS, above
him Nomentanae, who acted as nomenclator (see Epp. 1. 6. 50, 8.), and be-
low him Porcina, another of his parasites. The place of honor was the eor-
ner-seat of the ‘ medius lectus,’ and next to that, on the first seat of the
‘imuS,’ was usually the place of the host. But it 8 pears that Nasidienus

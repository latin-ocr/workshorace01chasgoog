ty (fourteen). The boy was 8 ‘ pupillus,’ not in relation vo his mother, but
to his tutor. Thus ‘ tutela’ and ‘custodia' were different things. ‘ Tutela'
was a technical term, ‘ custodia ' was not.

25. locupletibus aeque] ‘ Aeque ' is repeated, though not wanted, just as
‘ inter ’ is repeated in S. i. 7, and elsewhere (see note). The Greek writers
used ὁμοίως in the same way.

27. Restat ut his] Horace says 118 is impatient, till he shall have reached
the pet-fection of active virtue and wisdom. But as he has not done so, it
only semains that he shall regulate and comfort his mind with such elemen-
tary knowledge of truth as 118 possesses, and be content with thau for, if he
cannot reach perfectiori, 118 1118γ make some steps towards it. ‘ His ’ means
that which hc has at his command.

28. Non possis oculo] The keen sight of Lynceus, one of the Argonauts,
who, as the story goes, could from Lilybaeum count the number of vessels in
8 flcet coming out of tho harbor of Carthago, has been proverbial in 811 ages.

3pl. odosa —prffkibere cher-aym] The gout in the hand is called ‘ nodosa’
from its twisting the joints of the fingere (S. ii. 7. 15). As to the construc-
tion of ‘ prohibere,' see C. i. 27. 4.

32. Est quadam prodire tenus Horace is probably indulging 8 little irony
at the expense of the philosop ers, in the implied compat-ison of their per-
ceptione and powers with those of Lynceus and Glycon, and in the humble
tone he takes towards them. ‘ Tenus,' as a general mle, takes the ablativo
of the singular, and is so used in the compound words ⁶ hactenus,' ‘eaoenus,’

Philosoph , Horace sayS, has remedies for every discsse of the mind. The
remedies e means ane the precepts of the wisc, to be derived from books
(37). Η8 also calls them ‘piacula' (36), which is equivalent to ‘medicar-
meuta,' because, disease being. attributed to the wrath of the gods, that which
should remove their wrath (‘ piaculum ³) was the means of removing discsse.
‘ Ter’ is used by way of keeping up the religious notion (that number being
common in all religious ceremonie8‚ sce C. i. 28. 36, 11.) ; ‘pure ' is used in
the same connection. The book must be read with 8 pure mind, as the bod
must be washed before sacrifice or libation can be offered. By ‘libello ’
understand Horace to mean any book that instructs the mind in virtue.

41. Virtus est vitium fuya-e] 1f γοα cannot all at once attain pez-fection,
you may at least begin to leam, and the first step towards virtue is to put
away vice. What follows is 811 illustration of this. ‘ You see what trouble
you take to escape from poverty‚ which you count the worst of 811 evils3 but
if γοα will only give heed to instruction, γοα shall· leam well to care about

· it. This is the sense. As to ‘repulsa,' see C. iii. 2. 17. He who would

secure an election, must have 8 command of money.

44. capitisque labore] ‘ Caput’ is here put for the whole body. We do
not use it so, bnt for the seat of intelligence, which the Romans placed in the
hem-t, not in the brain. On ‘ per saxa, per ignes,' see C. iv. 14. 24; S. ii.

47. Meter-es ea] ‘In order that γοα may cesse to care for those things
which you now so foolishly admits and long for, will γοα not leam and lis-
oen, and trust the ex rieuce of 8 better 111811 than yourself‘l’ As tothis
position of ‘ne,' see . iv. 9. 1.

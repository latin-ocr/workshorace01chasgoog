107.) ‘Lapis albus ' was a small side-table of white marble. The wealthy
Romans had a great variety of tables of the handsomest sort in their dining-
roomS‚ for exhibiting their plate. (See below, S. 2. 4, n.; and above, S. 3.
13, n.) All the plats Horace had to show was two eups and a c athus (C.
iii. 19. 12), and these it is probable were usually empty. The ‘ ee inus ' is a
vessel nowhere else mentioned by that name, and is variously interpreted as
a salt-cellar (in the shape of an ‘ echinus ' or sea-hedgehog), a glass bottle‚ a
leather bottle‚ and a wooden bowl in which to wash the cu s. ‘ Paterae ’
were broad, flat, saucer-shaped cupS, and were much used in li atious. ‘ Gut-
tus ’ was a long, thin-necked bottle, from which wine or oil was poured very
slowly, drop by drop. It was also used in libatione, and these two vessels,
as here joined, have reference to the practice of offex-ing a libation at every
meal to the Lares. See C. iv. 5. 34, n. These were of the commonest sai-then-
ware which came from Cam ania. See S. ii. 3. 144.

feeling that he must be up early to go to the Forum, where a statue of Mar-

having gained the victory, caused Kiarsyas to be flayed alive. Marsyas or
Silenus was the symbol of a city having the Jus Italicum, one part of which
was a free constitution of its own. It would therefore appear in the Forum
as the symbol of free jurisdiction. The onl· representatione of Marsyas that
remaiu, exhibit him either in the ny o punishment, or in the suspense
that preceded it. Wherefore “a arsyas countenance'’ was synonymous
with dejection and ill-humor; and Horace seems to indicate that his face was
distorted‚ and ascribes it humorously to his detestatiou of the younger No-
vius, who is said to have been a usurer. ·

122. Ad quartam jaceo 5] The first hour he considers late enough for any
man to sleep (Epp. i. 17. 6). Sometimes he got up early and went out to
walk (S. 9); but as a general rule he remained in bed till the fourth honr,
after which he got up and took a stroll, as he had done the evening before3
or else, after reading and writing (or thinking, as he says S. 4. 133) by him-
self (‘ tacitum ') and in bed, as much as he felt inclined, he anointcd himself
with oil, and went to the Campus Martius to get some exercisc. The Ro-
mans rubbed oil on their limbs‚ either before swimming in the Tiber (C. iii.
12. 7, S. ii. 1. 8), οι· before their more violent exercises (C. i. 8. 8, sqq.).

125. Affii mesenum] When the sun began to get hot about nonu, and
Horace was tired with his garns, he went to the public baths to bathe, which
was usual ather laying, and then took a light luncheon (see above, S. 5. 25,
n.), after which lounged at home till evening‚ when he went out for his
stroll perham, and came home again to his supper, as he told us before.
‘ Lusum trigonem ’ was a game of ball only mentioned elsewhere by Martial.
The playerS, as the name irnplie8‚ were three in number, and stood in a tri-
angle. Their skill appears to have been shown in throwing and catching the

magistracy, when the ‘ quaestores ’ had charge of the ‘ aerarium ’ or public
treasury, was at this time one of little weight. Its functions were not clearly
defined· Horace was a scriba in the dunestor-'s office, which perhaps leads
him to speak of a quaestor. The office was high enough for the occasion,

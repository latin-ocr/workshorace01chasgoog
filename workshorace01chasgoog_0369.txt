ODE 11.

Intus Art-remus was son of M. Antonius the triumvir. He was a man
of letters and a poet. In B. c. 17 the ‚Sigambrh with two other German
tribes, crossed the Rhine and laid waste part of the Roman territory in Gaul.
They defeated the legate LolliuS, and this disaster was sufficient to induce
Augustus to'go in person to Gaul, which he did, and at his approach the
· Germans withdrew into their own territories, and, giving hostageS, obtained
peace. The defeat of Lollius had caused gr'eat consternation at Rome, and
the news of the barbarians' subjection was hailed with proportionate joy.
Augustus did not return for two years to Rome, having meanwhile restored
order in Germany, Gaul, and Spain 3 but it is probable this Ode was written
in the ex ctation of his return, and while the news respecting the Sigambri
was still resh, that is to say, about the end of B. c. 16. Augustus's return
to Rome was expected long before it took place (see C. 5 of this book).
The general impression derived from the Ode is that Antonius had pressed
Horace to write a poem in honor of Augustus's victory in the style of

Pindar’s ἐπινίκια, and that he very wisely declined. At the same time he
pays Antonius the eompliment of saying that he could celebrate Augustus’s
victory better than himself.

Aneuumvr. -Whoso would rival Pindar must expect the fate of Icarus.
His numbers roll like a swollen river. His is the bay, whether he tune the
dithyramb or sing of gods and heroes, of victors or of women bereaved. The

Thou, Antonius, shalt sing of the triumphs of Caesar‚ greatest and best,
and of the holiday rejoicings that hail his return: and Ι will add my small
voice to thine : and we will all sing songs of triumph, and will sacrifice, thou
with bulls and cows, I with a young heifer.

2. Iule, Virgil makes this name trisyllabic‚ after the Greek. Antonius's
grandmot er on his father’s side was J ulia, one of the Caesam, though how

for himse s and Icarus, his son, wingS, fastened to their shoulders with wax.
Those of Icarus melted, and he fell into the AEgean, part of which was
called after him (see C. iii. 7. 21). As to the plural ‘nomina‚' see C. iii.
27lgsshova—Ve’r-lm] The ‘ dithyrambuS,’ of which word the etymology is
uncertain, was a song in honor of Bacchus, and sung at his festivals, It

’ was wild and enthusiastic in its character. ‘ Nova verba' signifies words

coined sor the occasion, as was common, and to be expected from the nature
of the poetry‚ of which the metre seemed to a Roman irregular and arbitary
(⁶ lege solutis ¹). A few fragments remain of dithyrambie poems by Pindar.
All his entire poems extant are ἐπινίκια, odes of triumph for victors at the
Olympio, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian gameS.

13. Seu deos reyesve] Among Pindar’s works were ὕμνοι, παιᾶνες, παρ-
θένια, π όδια, in honor of the godS, and ε’ κώμια, in honor of illustrious
men. fige ma have written on the subject 0 the victory of Peirithous over

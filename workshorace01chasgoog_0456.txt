ably notorious. Horace does his best to shake him off, but he is too amiable
to eope with the effrontery of his companion, whose object is to get, through
Horace, an introduction to Maecenas, The man's vulgarity and want of taet
are conspicuous throughout the scene, while Horace exhibits in every part

d breeding and an amiable temper3 and though he is tried to the utmost
y reflectione on his patron and his friendS, he is incapable of saying a rude
word, is taken off his guard continuall , and is amusingly conscious of his
inferiority to the man of insolence on gis own ground. The effect of this
picture is heightened by the introduction‚ towards the end of the scene, of Fus-
cus AristiuS, an old friend of the poet, and a man of the world, who, like
Horace, understood character, but had that sort of moral courage and promp-
titude which his friend wanted. The readiness with which he takes u the
joke and enters into Horace's absurd position, and the despair to whic his
desertion reduces the oet, are highly ludicrous. After various ineffectual -
attempts to get rid of t e man, Homce is at last delivered by one who seizes
upon the intruder and carries him off to appear before the praetor on some
suit he has· against him.

1. Ibam soree via Sacra,] Horace does not mean that it was his custom to
stroll on the Sacra Via, especially at that hour in the morning, about eight
o'clock (v. 35) 3 but that, when he walked, his mind generally diverted itself
with trifles, being of an easy turn, and having few anxieties to trouble it. On
the Via Sacra, see Epod. iv. 7, n.; vii. 8, n. ⁶

5. Suaviter ut nunc est,]p ‘ Pretty well as times go ’; by which ‘he· means

nothing at all, not earing what he answers, but annoyed at the forwardness

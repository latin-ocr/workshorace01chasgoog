230. nubes et inania captet] As to the construction with ‘indigna ' in the
next verse, see C. iii. 21. 6, n., and Epp. i. 3. 35, n.

234. dominantia nomina solum Verbaque,] As to ‘ nomina verbaque,' see -

the ‘ crassa Minerva’ of the ancients, ‘ wisdom under a rough exterior‚’ and
it is in his graver character that Horace here views him. All ancient repre-
sentations of Silenus exhibit him as a gross impersonation of sensuality and
low fun, usually drunk, and riding upon an ass, with Fauns dancing about
him. Modern ideas have confounded him with Bacchus, his foster-child.

240. Ex noto fictum carmen sequar-,J ‘ Ex noto ’ perhaps means that the
subject must be familiar.

244. Fauna] See C. ii. 19. 4, n. Horace says that these rough beings
introduced from the woods should not talk as if they had been born in the
city and were loungers in the Forum, or languish in love-verses like a silly
youth 3 but neither should low language be put into their mouth, for this ιε
sure to offend the refined part of the audience, even if the vulg-ar applaud it.
‘Juvenorg is a word not found elsewhere: it is adapted from the Greek
νεανιευεο· αι. ”

248. et pater] ‘These who had a father ’ means ‘ingenui‚’ those who
were born free and of lawful wedlock, since none others were ‘ in patria po-
testate? As to ‘cicer‚’ see S. i. 6. 115, n.

251. Syllaba lonya brevi] As to the ‘ iambuS‚’ sce above, v. 79, sq. Horace
here calls it ‘pes eitus‚' a rapid foot‚ as elsewhere (C. i. 16. 24) he speaks of
‘ celeres iambos.' He says the rapidity of the foot caused the division of the
verse into the form of a trimeter, whereas it was a ‘schal-iu& having six
distinet iambic feet. The admission of a spondee in the odd feet, he says,
was an after invention, in order to give more *veight to the measure. ‘ Non
ita pridem ¹ means comparatively lately; but the verses of Archilochus had
&zama {2¹331211'3f12‘} gigss‘s'lioilnnssfievssii'erss‘ssffifflssgesffss‘izcssoiffi1&imfiff
jura paterna recepit ' is to be rendered ‘gave a share of its patrimony! The
meaning is clear enough from the context. The politencss of the ‘ iamb‘us ’
in making way for the spondeo, and giving up some of its just rights, but not
disposed to be so accommodating as to give up the even places in the verse,
selzemshrather a heavy joke. ‘ Socialitcr‚ ‘in a friendly way,’ does not occur
e sew ere.

258. Hic et in Aeci] See Epp. ii. 1. 50. 56. The iambus, Horace says, is
‘not commonly used in the verses of Accius and Ennius. Those of the for·
mer he calls noble trimeters, by which he means famed. He was no great
admirer of them himself. The great weight he attributes to the verses of
Ennius arose from the gravity of the measure, consisting, as v. 260 does,
chiefly of spondees. But the absence of the iambuS, in the opinion of Horace,
convicts him either of slovenly writing, or of ignorance of his art. ‘ Hic'
governsi· t‘hpre'mit' (v. 262), as it does ‘apparet.' ‘ This,’ that ie, ‘the ab-

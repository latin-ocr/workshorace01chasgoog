maenus, — Boon 1. 543·

not to be blamed for imitating Archilochus in bis measure and the structure
of his verse, for Alcaeus and Sappho (he says, and we must take his word for
it) did the same; they temper-ed their Muse with the measure of Archilochus.
The iambics of Archilochus are imitated by Horace in the EpodeS. Other
measures of his he has imitated in the Odes. There is little left of Archi-
lochus but his iambics. The vigorous style ¹of Sappho's fragments shows
the reason why Horace calls her ‘ mascula) See C. ii. 13. 24, n.
32. Hunc 29⁰ non alio dict-um] Compare C. iv. 9. 3 :
“ Non ante vulgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis '' ;

and 3. 23 : “ Romanae fidicen lyrae.” ‘ Hunc ' Orelli refers to AlcaeuS,
comparing C. iii. 30. 13 :

“ Princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos

Deduxisse modos.''

It may refer to Archilochus. Ι do not feel certain about it. Forcellini only
mentions one other example of ‘immemoratus ’ from Ausonius, ⁴ Ingenuis ’-
means ‘ candid ' or ‘ uncorrupted.’

35. inm-atus] He means that the readcr is ungrateful who gets gratifica·
tion from his poems at home, and yet ahuses them abroad. ‘ Ingratus ’
belongs to the second clause as well as ‘ iniquus! The reason Horace gives
is, that he does not go about secking the good opinion of vulgar critics, giving
them dinners and cast-off clothes, and so on, but keeps himself to the com-

any of respectable authors, listening to their writings and getting them to
risten to his own. The language is taken from the notion of canvassing for
votes at an election.

39. auditor ec ultor These words are reciprocal. The man who listens to
a stupid recitat10n as his rcvenge when he recites in return. Here it is
meant in a good-humored way. J uvenal's first Satire begins, “ Semper ego
auditor tantum? nunquamne reponam ‘3'’ As to the practice of recitation
among friends and in public, see C. ii. l, Int.‚ and S. i. 4. 73, n.

40. Grammaticos ambire tribus] Those who made a profession of literature
were called ⁴ literati‚' ‘⁴ cruditi‚' or ‘ grammatici? The last name was applied
principally to those who kept schools or· gave lectures, of whom there were a

reat many at this time at Rome. Inferior writers would give a· good deal
or their favorable opinion, which would help their books into demand among·
their scholars. Horace calls them ‘ critici ' elsewhere (A. P. 78). ‘ Pulpi-
tum ’ meant any raised platform from which speeches were delivered. Here
it applies to that from which the teachers delivered their lectures.

41. Hinc illae lacrimae] This became a common way of speaking after·
Terence (Andr. i. 1. 99): “Atat hoe illud est: Hinc illae lacrimae, haee
illa est misericordia.'’

Spissis indiqna theatris] ‘ Theatra ' here means any audience before which
recitations of this kind might take place, though the poeti-y of popular writers
was recited in the theatres by ‘ mimi ' and ‘ mimae.’

43. Jove's auribus] This is the same sort of expression as S. ii. 6. 52: “deos
quoniam propius contingis? ‘ Manare ' is not commonly used as a transitive
verb. In this construction we find the like wordS‚ ‘ flere,’ ‘ plucre‚’ ‘ stillare‚’
‘ rorare,' 8⁶0. The expressions ‘ nugis,' ‘poetica mella,’ ‘tibi pulcher,’ all
seem to apply rather to the lvrical compositions than to the Satires, and the
former appear to have been the objects of all this servile imitation.

b 45. naribus uti] See S. i. 6. 5, ῐι., and Persius (i. 40) : “nimis uncis Nari-
us indulcesss'

47. dil1‘1'dia posca] This word occurs nowhere else. It means, in the first
instance, an interval allowed to gladiators between their contestS. ‘ Iste
locus ' must mean the ‘ pulpita ’ or ‘ spissa theatra ⁹ above mentioned. It
seems as if the speaker meant to gain time, and, without declining the eon·

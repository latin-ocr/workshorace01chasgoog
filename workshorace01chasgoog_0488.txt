stand naked in the Tiber, to wash away his sins. This is ‹intended 'to repre-
sent another foreign superstition, as -the Romans held it, that of bathing the,
body vin token of the purifyiug of the soal.

295. Quone malo] See S. i. 10. 21 on ‘ quone! ‘ Timor deorum ' is equiv-
alent to δεισιδαιμονία in its usual sense of superstition. ‘Deorum metus'
expresses a right sear or reverence of the gods, But the distinction was not
invariably observed.

296. sapientum octavus] That 13, he might take his place with the seven
wisc men of Greece. ‚

297. ne compellaret· inultus] ‘ Compellare ’ is sometimes used absolutely
and in a bad sense, that is to abuse, as here.

299. Respicere ι’φιοιο] This refers to AEsop's fable of the two wallets,
which is told, with its moral, in five lines by Phaedrus (iv. 10) :

“ Peras imposuit Jupiter nobis duas:
Propriis repletam vitiis post tergum dedit,
Alienis· ante pectus suspendit gravem.
Hac re videre nostra mala non possumus3
Alii simul delinquunt, censores sumuS.”

300. sic vendas omnia pluria] On ‘ sic,' see C. i. 3. 1, n. ‘Pluris ' is simply
ut for ‘magna' Horace quietly hints to Damasippus that he had better
eave off philosophy and return to his trade, in which he wishes him all

success,

303. Agave] How she and the other Maenads tore her son Pentheus to
,picces for intruding upon the orgies, is related at length by Ovid. (Met. iii.

01, s ⁴ .. .
eosfl‘ffedfficas, boc est‚] ‘ You are building, which is as much as to say,
you, who are a dwarf two feet high, are aping the airs of a giant3 and yet
you laugh at Turbo (a gladiator of great courage, but small stature), swell-
mg with a spirit too big for his little body! Horace may have been making
some additions to his Sabine house, and about this time Maecenas built his
large house on the Esquiliae. (See S. i. 8, Introduction.)

312. verum est] δίκαιόν ἐστ-ις ‘is it right? ' Compare Caesar, B. G. iv. 8:
“ Neque verum esse qui suos fines tueri non potuerint alienos occupare.'’ See
also ›Liv iii. 40.

313. ancum dissimilem] A similar construction occurs immediately below
(ver. 317), ‘tantum magna.’ ‘ Multum similis ' (S. ii. 5. 92), ‘multum dis-

similis ’ §Epp i. 10. 3), are like phrases. ‘ Tanto ' is the dative govemed by
‘ certare.

314. Absentis ranae] This fable is told by Phaedrns (i. 24).

318. My’or dimidio. Num tanto ἓ] ‘ Greater by half? is a way of speaking
which must not be taken literally. Β - ‘num tanto’ the frog means -to -ask
whether the. calf was so much bigger t an her natural size aS, b =puffing‚ she
had made herself. ‘ Is it so much bigger'ss ’ she says, blowing ersel‘f out to
prgggnzpllzffipcthgessaffigrffzrzgss ligabam else. It means to be out of har-
mon wi .

322 sanus] See A. P. 296: “Excludit sanos Helicone poetas Democri-
tus-'³ There is not much consistency >in Damasippus urging Horace to write
a} the beginning of the satire, and calling him mad for doing so at the end
o it.

323. horrendam rabiem] This charge against himself need not be taken
seriously. We have no reason to believe Horace was an ill-tempercd man.
He laments the facility of his temper on one occasion. (S. i. 9. 11.) But he
says he is irritable. (Epp. i. 20. 25.)

Cultum ma ‘orm ceusu] ‘ Your living beyond your income.' Horace tries
to stop him„ the man {⁰³⁸ on with one instance of his folly after another.

245. tua de sejudicio {tque Munera,] Respecting Virgil and Varius, see
S. i. 5 40, n. Augustus had an affection for them both, and a Scholiast says
he made each of them a present of a million sesterces.

248. aenea siqua] The word ‘ signum ’ applies generally to all earved or
cast figures, while ‘ statua’ ap lies only to full-length figures.

255. C'laustmque custodem pacis cohibentia] That which is commonly called
the Temple of Janus was a passage enclosed between two gates leadingout
of the city. A statue of Janus was placed there, and from this and the two
gates the lace was called Janus Geminus. It was built, according to tra-
dition, b uma (Livy i. 19). The gates were open in war aud closedjn

262. Discit enim citius] ‘ Quis’ belongs both to ‘discit’ and to ‘deridet.’
Horace says men are more apt to remember what is ridiculous than that
which is good and serious3 and therefore it is not pleasant to have one’s
name associated with silly verses or an ugly wax image, such as the admirere
of public men might think to honor them with. Busts of literary and other
distinguished men were put up in the public librar-ies (see S. i. 4. 21, ιι), and

Horace speaks of being stretehed out in an open box as if he were a eorpse
being carried on a ‘vilis area’ (S. i. 8. 9, u.) to the common burialeground,
that ie, to the grocer's shop. ‘ Vicum’ may mean the ‘ Vicus Thurarius,'
which was a part of the Vicus Tuscus mentioned S. ii. 3. 228. ‘Porrectus ’
is used commonly for corpses. ‘Aperta' keeps up the notion of a ‘sandar-
pila,' or common bier, on which the poor were carried out to burial. In plain
lauguage‚ Horace says he might ex eet his panegyrist's verses to be carried
to the groeer (to whom and the trunE-maker waste paper goes still), and him-
self to be held up to ridicule with the author.

first Book was written. (See Introduction.) Its professed purpose is to

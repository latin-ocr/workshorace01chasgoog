diemselves. The tradition was,·that on one occasion, when Lydia was suf·
fering from famine, the king, Atys, divided the pcople into two equal parts, of
whom one remained at home, and the other took ship and made the coast of
Etruria, and there settled, under Tyrrhenae, the son of Atys. Horace and
Virgil (Aen. ii. 781) both adopted this story, which was familiar to men of
learning, and perhaps believed by many. ⁴ Lydorum quidquid,' ⁸ all the
Lydiiaus ἱρὴίη ever inhabited,’ etc, is like Epod. v. 1: “ At, o deorum quid·
ui in cae o ·t.'’

5. naso suspendis adunco] This the Greeks expressed δγῐιυκτηρίζειν. It
is taken from that instinctive motion of the features which expresses eon-
tempt. How to account for it may not be easy, though it is so common.
The expression ‘ naso suspendere ’ Horace may have invented, It occurs
nowhere else, except in Persius (S. i. 118) It rs repeated below, S. ii. 8. 64:
“ Balatro suspendens omnia naso.'’ ‘ Ut ’ escun-ing twice in these two lines
introduces confusion. The second means ‘ as for instance)

6. libertino patre natum] The difference between ‘libertus ’ and ‘liberti-
nus ' is, that the latter expressed a man who had been manumitted, the for·
mer a freedman in his relation to thc- master who had given him his freedom.
The son of a ‘libertinus,' born after his father’s manumission, and all other
persons born free, were ‘ingenui' ; and Horace says that MaecenaS, thou h
he would not take into his intimacy 'a frecdman, made no inquirv as to e
parengage of an‘y one born free, but would make him his fnend if he de-

selae Arilla potestatem Tullifl Horace here follows the legend which made
Servius Tullius the son o a slave-girl, and himself a slave in the palace of
King Tarquinius (see Livy, i. 39). On this account his reign was ignoble,
while iu true nobility it was sui-passed by none of the others. Another legend
(which Ovid foll0w3, Fast. vi. 627, sqq ) makes Tullius the son of Vulcan3
but his mother is there also a slave, having been taken captive at Cornicu-
lum, a city taken b Tarquinius Priscus.

12. Laevinum, cleri yenus] The Valeria gens was one of the most an·
cient in Rome, and embraced some of the most distinguished familieS‚ among
others that of Publicola, the earliest member of which mentioned in history is
Valerius Publicola, the colleague of Brutus after the ex ulsion of the kingS.
The family of Laevinus was another distinguished branc of the same gens.
The Laevinus in the text is said to have been a man of abandoned character,
so bad that even the populace, who were not easily deterred from conferring
their honors upon· the viciouS, could not be prevailed on by admiration of his
high ancestry to advance him beyond the quaestorship 3 that is to say, he
never held a curule office. As to ‘ genus,’ see C. i. 3. 27. On ‘ unde,’ which
is equivalent to ‘ a qu0,’ see C. i. 12. 17, n.; ii. 12. 7. ‘ Fugit’ is the historie
present, as it is called.

14. pluris licuisse,] ‘ Licere ’ is ‘ to be put up for sale,’ and its correlative
term is ‘liceri,’ ‘to bid for an article at a sale by auction.' ‘Notare' is to
set a bad mark upon, to brand, and was technically applied to the consors
(sce note on v. 20). ‘Judice quo nosti' is an instance of atu-action, which
figure the Romans bon-owed from the Greeks, but did not use so commonly.

Quid oportet Nos facere] Horace means to say, that those who by educa-
tion and profession and experience were very far removed from the common
people, ought to judge differently from them, and better. In this number he

aee therefore does not use the word in its legal sense. The Getae lay towards
the mouths of the Danube, while the Daci were situated to the west os them,
on the same or south side of the river.

23. Seres— Tamrm] See C. iii. 29. 27, n. The Seres and Indi are not
much distingmishcd by Horace (sce C. i. 12. 56), and, when he is referring to
the East, their names are generali associated with the Parthians, more for
the sake of amplification than with historical or geographical accuracy. The
Roman armies had not yet even crossed the Tigris. But when Angustus was
in Syria, we are infor-med by Suetonius, ambassadors came from the far East
to ask his protection and alliance.

25. lucibus] This word is used for ‘diebus ' by ovid (Fast. iii. 397) :—

The conclusion of this Ode recalls C. iv. 5. 31, sq.

' 30 Lydis] Plato tells us that the Lydian and Ionian melodies were best
suited to delicacy and feasting, the Dorian and Phrygian to wau-5 and Aris-
totle that the Lydian were most suitable to the tendet age of boyhood, as
harmonizing the mind and training it to good. There is no particular force,
however, here in the word ‘ Lydis! As to ‘tibiis‚’ see C. i. l. 32, n. The
pipes used by the Lydians themselves are called by Herodotus (i. 17) αὐλός
:infinitos and αὐλὸς γυναικήῒος, probably as representing the voices of a man
an a woman respectively.

31. Anchisen] The family of Anchises, the grandfather of Iulus, are men-
tioned here, because Augustus belonged by adoption to the Julian family, of
which Iulus was the reputed founder.

72. Huncine solem Tam nigre-um suffere] ‘Huncine' is compounded of the
pronoun, the demonstrative enclitic ‘ ee ' (for ‘ecoe‚' ‘ behold ')‚ and the inter-
rogative enclitic ‘ne' (Key’s L. G. 293). As to ‘surrexess see S. i. 5. 79 ;

goa. Rapit injus ς] ‘In jus vocare ’ is a technical expression having refer-
ence to the first step in a civil action when both parties appeared before the

SATIRE X.

Tim line of sels-defence Horace took in the fourth Sat-ire (see Introduction,
and v. 6, n.) led him into a criticism of LuciliuS, which gave a fresh handle
to his adversaries, who professed an admiration for that poet, but admired
him for his worst faults of haste, and especially for his combination of Greek
words with his mother tongue‚ —a practice the affectation of which no one
would more instinctivcly feel and condemn than Horace. Horace adheres
to his criticisrn, and says, if Lucilius had lived, he would have been the first to

particular kind of play that we know of. He died the year before the battle
of Philippi, Α. 11. c. 711, and therefore before this Satire was written. The
Roman mimes were, in the time of LaberiuS‚ represented in the theatres with
the regular drama. They were a combination of grotesque dnmb·show, of ἀ
dances by meu and women, of farcical representatione in verse-dialogue‚ of
incidente in low and profligate life, and of grave sentiments and satirical al-
lusions interspersed with the dialogus. Aug-ustus was a great patmn of these
lieentious representatione. See Tac. Ann. i. 54.

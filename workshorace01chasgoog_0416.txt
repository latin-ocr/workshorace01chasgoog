36. stipendium 2] It is possible this ma 'mean ‘ service,’ which is its·
military sense; or it may be ‘ penalty‚’ but t e meaning is doubtful. ‘ Quae
finis ' means ‘ what death? ' captives led in triumph were always put to
death. See C. iv. 2. 35, n. -

40. sonari .·] ‘ Sono ’ is used as an active verb only by the poeta, after
the manner of ἠχεῖν. Τ116 satire of’w'hat follows is very amusing. In his
plea. for forgiveness he repeats his offence, implying that to eall her chaste he
must lie, which, however, he is willing to dc. The following words are the
substance of what he promises to say in her praise, placing her, like Ariadne
and other virtuous women, among the constellationS.

42. Infantis Helenae] The story is, that Stesichorus (C. iv. 9. 8, 11.) was
struck with blindness for writing a libel on Helen, and that on writing a ref

cantation (παλινῳδία) 116 was restored to sight hy Helen, or, as Horace here
{Zyifiiffligpssss‘ffss'ffizfflssss {zssfflzzx βοοὲἐοῗῖιῑῧῗωὲἑέᾗέἰίῗοὲἷξ
used χάριν and μοῖραν 111 the same way. ’

45. potes nam,] This is a common formula in entreaties both in Greek
(δύνᾳ γάρ) and Latin.

46. Ο nec paternis] ‘ Ο thou who art not debased by the sins of thy
parents, who art not an old witch skillcd in sprinkling on the ninth day the
ashes on the tombs of the poor.’ In this way, while he pretends to recant, he
makes his language more libellous than ever.

obsoleta] This is applied in an unusual sense. It usually signifies that
which is gone to decay (out of use), as clothes, houscS, fadcd pictures, &c.
(see Forcell.)‚ and so it comes to mean generally that which is spoilt and
worthless‚ as here. See C. ii. 10. 6.

48. Novendiales] It appearS, if we are to believe the old commentatore,
to have been the practice to bury the ashes nine days after death. Therefore,
Horace means to say that the witch dug up the ashes of the dead immediately
after their burial, while they were fresh, and better suited on that account for
magical ceremonies. The ashes of the poor are fixed upon, perhaPS, because
they were not watched as the rich man's were. ‘ Novcndiales ’ usually signi-
fies ‘ of nine days’ continuance,' but it cannot have that meaning here.
Hector was buried after nine days (11. xxiv. 784).

50. Tuusque venter Pactumeius,] In Epod. v. 5 it is insinuated that Canidia
is childless, that the children she pretends to have are not hem, and her child-
births are a fiction, perhaps to extract money from her lovers, on whom her
pretended children were affiliated. Here the libel is withdrawn‚ but in such
¹argvayl as ttolleaye it⁵ unt01(11‹}hfficd,1{0r ‘mvtluta last line dhei) intignulates that her
that would haxsse begu intelligible at’the time.

53. Quid obseratis] From this point Canidia is supposed to repl .

56. ιιι tu riseris] ‘ Ut ³ is an exclamation of scorn. ‘ To think that you
should.' It occurs again (S. ii. 5. 18) : ‘⁸ Utne te am spurco Damae latus l '’
The festival in honor of Cotys or Cotytto was of hracian origin, and trans-
ferred to Corinth and other Greek states. It found its way into Sicily, but
was never introduced into the Italian states, and was unknown at Rome ex-
cept to the learned. The rites of this goddess were very impure, and, like
other works of darkness, professed secrecy, as Juvenal says (11. 91) :—

“ Talia secreta coluerunt orgia taeda ·
Cecropiam soliti Baptae lassare Cotytto.’'
Canidia is made to call her witch's orgies Cotyttia‚ by which the libel that
runs thro h the poem is maintained.

12. δι’ parcent animae] Cic· ad Fam. (xiv. 14): “Vos meae carissimae
animae quum saepissime ad me scribite.'' Since ‘metuam ' here and ‘ patiar}
below (v. 15) arethe present subjunctive, ‘ parcent‚' following those words,
should, in strict Latini ‚ bo ‘- arcane’ But the, same construction occurs
above (C. rii. 3. 7). &giy ch oe 'should be a Thracian, and Ornytus of
Thurii (see S. ii. 8, 20, n.)‚ is not worth questioning.

17. prisca] Forcellini gives other instances of this nse of ‘ priscu8,' where
‘pristinus ’ is‘more usual.

18. juyo coyitl ‘Jugo ' is gov‘erned by ‘ cogit‚' and ‘diductos ' stands alone,
‘ parted though we be! .

19. excutitur] The English “cast off '' expresses the meaning· best.

22. improbo] On' the meaning of ‘improbus ⁹ as a word expressing ‘ex-
cess,' se'e below (C. iii. 24. 62). Here it means ‘violent,’ ‘urricus’

ODE X.

Tms is supposed to be sung by a lover under the window of his mistress,
who on a cold night refuses him admission. It is what the Greeks called a

’ἑᾞαὲἒωσῶἶῗῗέρἕἒὲξ ἓῗ» ξ’ἑῗὲξὲ ἒῗὲἓὲ ἒὲῑξέξηῗέἐᾛέἑ“ἒ’.“ι.ῖ“ἒ;ἱέ.ῗέθῖιὲἳ
’πο may suppose Horace had some poem of the sort in his ,mind whe’n he
wrote this. The thirteenth Ode of the fourth book is nominally connected
‘with this3 but as there is no necessity for supposing, nor any likelihood, that
Horace wrote this from his own experience‚ so neither is it likely that he ·
wrote that to taunt in her decline the girl who is supposed to reject his ad-

dresses here.

Annum-mr. — Were Scythia thy dwelling-plac‘e‚ Lyce, this inelement
night should move thee to pity me. Hear how the wind h0w1s; see how the
snow lies freezing. Venus loves not pride: the rope may break and the
wheel run back; though nothing bends thoe, neither presentS, nor prayers,
nor these sallow chceks of mine, nor thy husband’s faithlessncSS‚ though thou
be hard as the oak and crue! as tho serpent, yet as a goddess have pity!
Flesh and blood will not stand this sor ever.

giat ventis,’ ‘echoes back to 'the winds their howling!

7. ut ylaciet] Itis easy to supply ‘vides,' or ‘sentiS‚' or any ,other word
more appropriate than ‘audis ² to the freezing of the snow. One verb of
sense is often made to serve for two or three. ‘ How Jove with his bright
power freezetb the snow as it lies.' ‘Jove’ is the atmosphere (see C. i. 1.
25, n.). ‘ Puro ’ is a good epithet to express a clear frosty night.

10. Ne currente retro funis eat rom] ‘ Lest the wheel turn back and the
rope wit-h it,’ ‘ retro ’ applying to both ‘ currente ' and ‘eat' The metaphor
is taken from a rope wound round a cylinder, which being anowed to run

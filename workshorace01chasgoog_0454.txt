verbial. Hence σῦκιγοι ἄνδρες meant men fit sor nothing. Priapus was a.
rural divinity, bormwcd by the Romans from the later mythology of the
Greeks. He was the protectores floekS, fields, and gemens, and symbolized
the fertility of nature generally. llis images were made in a rough fashion,
and the ancients had but little respect for him, unless it were those of the
lowest sort; though Horace, who treats him so contemptuously here, speaks
of him elsewhere (Epod. ii.), in conjunction with silvanae, as receiving the
sacrifice due to him. No one could better have appreciated than a Roman
of Horace’s way of thinking, whether, in respect to this deity or any other,
the ironical description of the prophet Isaiah (xliv. 9 -2o), which may be re·
ferred to with advantage. There is no stroke in the whole of that description
more severe than Horace’s “ incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum Maluit
esse deum.'' The figures of Priapus were generally busts‚ but sometimes
they were suu length, of the kind Horace describes. Usually they held a
sickle or a elub in their right hand, by way ‚of frightening thieves, and a. wisp
of straw, or something of that sort, to ffighten the birds.

6. asponam volucres] Virgil applies the same epithet to destructive birds:
“ Obscoenaeque canes importunaeque volucres '' (Georg. i. 470). The word
is used with a variety of meaningS, to reduce which to one character we must
know more than we do of its et 'mology.

8. Huc prius anqustis] See troduction. The poor people were buried
in ill-dag graves, which had the name ‘ puticuli,’ probabi a form of ‘ putei?
The manner of their funeral is here stated with painfu satire. The poor
wretch is neglected by his masten and a follow-slave, out of his ‘ peculium,’
goes to the expense of hiring (‘ locabat’) ‘ vespillones ’ (common corpse-
bearers, νεκροφόρους) to carry him out on a bier to the public burial-ground,
where his coi-pse was tossed naked into a pit into which other corpses had
been tossed before. This scene could not have occurred in all its particulare

master of the slave· The ‘vilis arca’ was called ‘ sandapila,' a bier of nar-
row dimensione.

11. Pantolabo scurrus Nomentanoque nepoti .·] As to these persons, see note
on S. 1. 101. In consequence of their extravagance‚ Priapus foretells they
will come to a pauper’s funeral.

12. Mille pedes m fronte,] This public burial-ground was 1,000 feet in
breadth and 300 in depth. ‘ In fronte’ vmeans fac-ing the public mad, the Via
Tiburtina (6. 108), οι· the Via Praenestina, one of which, or both, must have
passed very close to it. (See Caesar, B. G. ii. 8, and Mr. Long³s note.) It
was usual to eng-rave on monuments the following lenem, Η. Μ. 11. rr. s.,
which stand for “ Hoc monumentum heredes non sequitur ”3 or Η. Μ. ΑΒ
n. n. rusus. The words were sometimes given at full length. Sometimes
nx τ. (ex testamento) were inserted between n. and N. Such sepulchres
were called ⁴ sepulcra familiaria '3 those that were built for a man and his
heirs were called ‘ hereditaria) Horace writes as if there were a stone
(‘ prpus ') which defined (‘ dabat ' 2 the extent of this burim-ground, and
bore the inscription usual on private monuments, 11. M. Η. N. s„ which is
obviously only a satire. The words could only appl to a private lace of
burial. All he reali means is, that a space of groun of the extent e men·
tions was marked for the burial of these poor ple.

14. Ntmc lieet Esquiliis] The whole of the ffiuiline or fifth region of
Rome was called Esquiliae. This, from having been an eye-sore and a
plagae-spot, became a healthy and pleasant residence. Suetonius tells us
that Augustus, when he was ill, went to Maeeenas’s house in the Esquiliae, to
reeruit (Octav. c. 72). T-he ‘agger' here referred to was a raised terrace,
commenced by Servius Tullius, and continued by Tarquiniusgfriscus, being

δ. Amida nec virtus After the battle of Canna, Hanm‘bal established
himself in Capua, and 'vy (xxiii. 6) relates a boasting speech of the cam-

They also sent ambassadors to Rome, and demanded, as a condition of their
assistance, that one of the consuls should alwa s be a Campanian. Five
years afterwards the Romans took the town, antl' dealt very severely with it,
reducing it to a pmefectura (see S. i. 5. 34, n.). As to Spartacus, -see C. iii.
ualliuobmaej The Allobroges, whose country la on the left bank of the
Rhene, between that river and the Isere, had am sadors at Rome at the
time of Catiline’s conspiracy, praying for redi-ess for certain grievances.
These men were tampered with by the conspiratum, and promised to forward
their designs‚ which, soon repenting, they betrayed, and became the principal
witnesses against the conspirators (Sall. Cat. 41; cie. in Catil. iii. 2-4).
This explains Horace’s meaning. Two years asterwards these ple, hav-

11. inmittet] ‘ Insistere ’ is followed by the accusative ease sometimes, par-
ticularly when it implies motion, as ‘ insistere viam‚’ which peculiarity is
found in the Greek καθέζομαι. It more usually governs the dative case, or
is followed by the ablativo after ‘ in! See Aen. vi. 563: “ Sceleratum insis-
tere limen.” Ezekiel’s prophecy ainst Tdyrc declares that Nebuchadnezzaae
‘⁴ with the hoofs of his horses shal tread own all her streem” (xxvi. 11);
and Jeremiah exclaims (viii. l, 2): “At that time they shall bring out the
bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princeS‚ and the bones of
the priests, and the bones of the prophete, and the bones of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem out of their graveS, and they shall spread them before the sun ε
they shall not be guthered nor be buried3 they shall be as dung on the face
of the earth.” Horace does not take account of the apotheosis of Romulus,
which he himself refers to elsewhere (C. iii. 3. 16). Porph ’on, on the
authority of Varro, says the tomb of Romulus was behind the ostra.

15. eapsde‘at] This belongs to ‘ carere ’3 ‘what course beflts us best, that
we be free from our vile sufferings,’ where the Greeks would express or (more

commonly) understand ὥστε. The story of the Phocaeans abandoning their
city when Harpa s was besieging it, and declaring that the would not
return till a bar o iron they threw into the sea should fleat, is to d by Herod·
otus (i. 165). It must have been familiar to educated men, and the form of
oath may have become proverbial. ‘ Exsecrata’ is used in a middle sense,
‘ binding themselves under a cursef ἐπῗεῆσαντο ἷξτχυρὰς κατάρας. So

EPISTLES». ·-- ΒοοΚ 1. v 533

v{lien-t deseription of Horaee’s resident-e, in antieipation of the inquiries he
supposes Quintius mig-ht make on that subject.

1. fundus] See S. ii. 5. 108, n.

2. Arvo pascat herum] Horace had some of his land under his own culti-
vatium but it was no great quantity, as we may infer from the number of
slaves employed upon it (S. ii. 7. 118). The rest he seems to have let (Epp.
14. 2, n.). Part of his land wa's amble, and part of it meadow (Epp. 15.
26-30, and C. iii. 16. 30, “segetis certa fides meae''). He had a. gurdon
(Epp. 14. 42). He must also have had vines (23, ιι). Ιιι short, it was an
ordinary farm on a small scale. In the second and third venees Horace ro-
οοίιιξιέο the different productione of his farm, while he supposes Quintius to
aa} οριῖἰξιῗιεῗῖι. This is 8 rare word, and does not occur in any earlier writer.
ul3. αζι muido vitibus ulma] See C. ii. 15. 5: “ platanusque caelebs Evineet

mos. '

5. Continui montes] The valley of the Licenza is the only valle which.
ente the range of mountains extending from the Cam above ibur to
Carseoli, about fort -five miles from Rome. Withouffl mlley this im-
mense body would 8 continuone mass. It lies nearly north and soum,
which corresponds with the description of the text. See C. i. 17 . 1, n.

8. Temperiem laudem] The position of the valley keeps it cool inv summer
and was-m in winter, the latter by the exclusion of the north wind (Tr-amon-
tana). The Seirocco (‘plumbeus Auster’) is modified in its strength and
character as it penetrates the mountains. .

Quid, si rubicunda] ·‘ Why, if 1 tell you that my thorus bear abundantly
the red eoi-nel and the plum, that my oaks and my ilexes deiight my pige
with plenty of acorns, and their master with plenty of shade, you may say it
is the woods of Tarentum, brought neat-er to Rome) ‘ Fruge’ is nowhere
else used for aeorns, the common food for pigs.

12. Fonsetiam] There are two small streame which seed the Lieenza in
this valle , which that river nearly biseets. Either- of these rivuleta may be
the one ee alludes to.

, 14. fluit utilia] See note on v. 8 of the last Epistle.

15. duleas, etium si credis amma] A place may be ‘ duleis' from· associ-
ation or other causes: it ean only be ‘ amoenus ' from its climata iu! besanes,
and so forth. As to ¹ Septembribus horis‚’ see S. ii. 6. 18, ιι., and foi: ‘ audis ’
see note on v. 20 of the same Satin-e.

17. Tu reete vivis] He goes on to eompliment and advise his friend:
‘Your life is what 1t should be, if you are eareful to be what you are ae-
eounted. For all Rome has long spoken of yon as a happy man. But 1 am
aii-aid lest you should trust the judgment of others about yon, rathes- than

our own.
y 24. pudor malus] See S. ii. 3. 39, n. He says it is 8 false obtine that
would induce a patient to conceal his sores from the ph sieian 3. and so* it is
for a man to hide his desecte, rather than bring them to tbe wiso to cure. .

25. Siquis bella tibi] ‘ Tibi ' depende on ⁴ pugnata‚’ which is joined with
‘bella’ in C. iii. 19. 4. See noto on C. ii. ὃ. 11. Quintius had no doubt
seen sei-viee·; but, says Horace, if any one were to speak of your campaign-
ing in such language as this (then he quotes two lines, said to be taken stom
the panegyrie of Varius on Augustus, referred to on C. i. 6. 11), yon would

Thou shalt rue my firmness, Neaera. Flaccus will bear ne rival. Let thy
faithlessness drive hun to wrath, and 110 will seek a true beart elsewhere. Let

form mere beautiful than Nireus; et shalt thou weep for her love transferred
to another, and my turn te laugh AEall come.

It applies to high-treason, whereby the majesty of the sovereign power is vio-
lated, and· to perjury, as blaspheming the name of God. Compare Ovid

will be found in C. i. 21. 2, “ Intensum pueri dicite Cynthium ”3 C. iii. 4.

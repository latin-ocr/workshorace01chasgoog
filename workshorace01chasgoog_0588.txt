292. Pompfflm minyada] The ‘ Calpurnia gens,’ ιο which the Pisonen
belonged, claimed descent from Calpus„ son of Numa Pompilius.

204. ad unquem] See S. i. 5. 32, n.

295. Inqentum misera] The following verses ιο 308 have little connection
with what goes before. Horace says, because genius is above art, and all
poete, according ιο Democritus, are mad, many neglect their persons and let.
their nails and their beai-ds grow, affeeting insanity. The question about
eduen-tion and nature in connection with poetry is taken up again at v. 408.
We are accustomed to subscribe to the doctrine “ poeta nascitur, non fit.”
The ancients were divided on that point, some assigning more to education,
others to natural gifts. Cicero more than once alludes to tho opinion of
DemocrituS‚ that no man could be a poet without inspiration.

300. δι’ tribus Amicyris] There were three places of this name, each of
which is assumed from this passage to have produced hellebore, a very im-
probable coincidence. Horace uts ‘ tribus ' as we might say a dezen, or
any other indefinite number. (geo S. ii. 3. 83.)

301. Tonsor-i Licino commiserat] This name was probably tha-t of a well-
known barber of the da . Sec S. ii. 3. 16. 35, n.)-

302. Qui pmyor bilem he hellebore which the ancients used in atses of
madness is a violent purgative, and they tried ιο act on the brain by relieving
the stomaeh. Horace says he must bc a fool‚ since madness is essent-iel to

secandi). This is said to be a proverbial way of speaking.

310. Rem tibi Socraticae-*chartaej Thc'writings of Socmtes’s discipleS,
such as Plato, Xenophon, AEschineS, Antisthenes, Aristippu3‚ will ,supply
matter for the true (dramatic) poet, by teaching him the scienee and duties

οέ3ι11ἳῗῗ21ιιιιὲθὲἰτ ωηεσνίριί,] After the expulsion of the kings‚ the senate hav-

ing lost many of its number under the last of them, the vacancies were filled
up from the ‘ equiteS,' who were called ‘ conscripti senatores! The others
were ‘patres ’ ; and the whole body thus constituted was eal-led collectively
⁶ patres et conscripti,' or shortly ‘ patres conscripti.' Horace here uses ‘ con-v
seri> tue’ as equivalent to ⁴ senator! It is nowhere else so used. As ιο
‘ju iciS‚’ see S. i. 4. 123, n.

318. vivas hinc ducere vacca] Living words are those that represent nature
ιο the life, or which convey a vivid sense to the understanding.

3119. speciosa locis] Full of telling commouplaces‚ sentimenta examples,
an so on. ,

323. Graiis ingenium] He says the Greeks had a natural teste for poetry‚
and cultivated it from an ambition to excel and thirst for praise. But this
comparison of the Greeks and Romans does not appear to be connected with
the subject that goes before, or the rules that follow from v. 333.

325. Romani puer-ij See S. i. 6. 72, 77. n. The ‘ as ’ was divided into
twelve parts, ‘ unciae,’ of which the ⁴ quincunx ' contained five, and the
⁸ triens ’ four, being one third of the whole, whence the name. The ‘ semis '
(semi-as) contained six, being half an as. Albinus is said to have been the
name o a usurer. Horace is oepreseuting a scene in a boys' school.
‘⁸ Maste»- .- Let the son of Albinus tell me: if you take an uncia from a uin-
eunx, how much remains ’ἒ (The boy hesitates.) You used to know. oy.-

early reminiscences. Trivicum was probably on a cross road (Cramer, ii.
259) which lay between the two branches of the Appia Via, one of which
took the most direct course from Beneventum through Venusia to Tarentum
and Brundisium, and the other took a more northerly course across the
ApennineS‚ near Equus Tuticus 3 and then, striking directly eastward till it
arrived very near the seacoast, near Cannae, proceeded down the line of coast
till it reached Brundisium.

lgtgimlehm Gzntaesi lapidoeus‚] In a plain between the hius and the right
bank of the Aufidus, about twelve miles fmm its mouth, stood the town of
Canusium (Canosa), one of the ancient Greek settlements of Apulia. This
town and others in Apulia (Venusia and Brundisium among them), and in
other parts of Eastern Italy, were represented to have bcen founded by Dio-
med, when, after the TroJan war, he was driven to the coast of Apulia, and
hospitably entertained and presented with land by Daunus, its king. His

name was retained by the islands now called Tremiti, but by the ancients -

Diomedeae. Man remains found among its ruins testify to the former im·
portance and th of Canusium. The present town stands on a height
where the citadel stood, and contains not above 300 houses. A suppl of
good water was brought into this town by Hadrian, the emperor. hat
A ulia was not well watened, has been observed before (Epod. iii. 16, n.).
The turbid waters of the Aufidus must have been unfit for drinking. The
bread of Canosa is described by modern traveller-s to be as bad as ever. It is
accounted for by the softness of the millstones.

takes it. The construction is not very agoeeable3 but to avoid it we must

Buvo, and was thirty miles from Canusium. The road fmm Canusium was
called Via Egnatia, from the town it led to. A modern traveller describes
the remains of it for twelve miles from Canosa as paved with common rough
pebbles, and passing over a pleasant down. -

³0. Est Ulubris] All that we know of 'Ulubrae is that it was a small
town of Latium, not far from Velitrae, and that it was a place of no im-

portanoe.

EPISTLE XII.

Icelus, to whom this Ε istle is addressed, has been mentioned, with all
that is known of him, iu t e Introduction to C. i. 29, and Pom ius Gros-
phus in C. ii. 16. It is a letter of introduction for Grosphus to ocius, who
was employed in managing Agrippa’s estates in Sicily. The Epistle begins
with some general remarks on the position and circumstances of Iccius, ex-
horting him to contentment, and commending his pursuit of philosophy in
the midst of common employments. It then pasees on to the recommenda-
tion of Grosphus, and finishes with one or two iterna of public news.

l. blandibat Ayn‘ppae] From what sources A 'ppa derived his immense
wealth we do not know. From this Epistle we earn that he had estates in
Sicily, probably given him after his successes against Sextus Pompeius. Hor-
ace means to say to Iccius, that he has got a good post, and may be ve
comfortable if he is careful. He probably got a percentage on what he -
lected. He collected Agrippa’s rents, ‘ fructus?

4. cni rerum suppetit usus] ‘ Rerum usus ' here seems to mean the supply
of things needfu . ‘ Suppeto,’ meaning ⁴ to be sufficicnt‚' occurs in Epod.
xvii. 64. ‘ Pauper’ is here used more in the senso of privation than Horace
generally uses it.

7. positorum] ‘ Ponere ’ is the usual word for putting dishes on the table,
as observed ou S. ii. 2. 23. Here fine dishes are meant, as we can ,tell by the
context. The nettle, ‘ urtica,’ fonns an ingredient in the broth os poor people
iu this country, and still more in Scotland. ‘Protinus ’ means ‘right on,'
and is applied in various ways. Here it means ‘in an uninterrupted course,’
that ia, ‘alwaysl ‘Ut’ means ‘even supposing,' asin Epod. i. 21. ‘ Con-
festim‚' ‘ straightway‚' has the same root as ‘ festino! ‘ Fortunae rivus ’
seems, as Orelli says, to' have been a proverbial expression.

10. naturum mutare] Horace says the samo in a different 'application else·
where Epod. iv. 5 ε ·

‹ ›“ Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genns.’'

12. Miramur si Democriti] ‘⁴ I am surprised that Democritus should have
allowed his sheep to eat-the corn off his fleme, while his mind was wandering
in swift fliffiht far away, leaving his body3 and yet you, in the midst of such
sordid wor and the infection of money, arc bent on wisdom‚ and that of no
mean sort, and continue to study things s.ublime.'' Democritus of Abdera
had a considerable patrimony, which he neglected for travel and stndy. It
seems his name had passed into a proverb.

20. Empedocles an Stertinium] Em docles was born about n. c. 520, and
was a man of wealth and station at grigentum in Sicily. He was a phi-
losopher, but his opinions are hard to traco. He pretended to a divine nature.
(See A. P. 463, s q.) His ms, of which fragments ane extant, were much
read and admit-eg by the omaus. Horace refers rhaps to a dogma im-
puted to Empedocles, to which Cicero alludes (De mic. vii.) when he says
“ Agrigentinum quidem doctum quendam virum carminibus Graecis vatici-
natum ferunt, quae in rerum· natura. totoque mundo constarent quaeque mo·

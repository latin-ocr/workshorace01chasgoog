belo to the Samnites, from whom it was taken by Q. Fabius. ( Sabelli
was e name given by the Romans to all the tribes which issued from the
Sabine stock, of whom the Samnites were one.) Apulia and Lucania were,
at the beginning of this war, independent states in close alliance with the
Samnites, but after the first year they found it for their interest to desert
those allies, and joined the Romam, with whom they continued to unite their
forces till the end of the war. Horace's supposition that one or other of
those states was meditating or carrying on war with Rome, >is not, therefore,
strictly accurate; but‚they were always very doubtful allies, and were glad to
assist their old enemies the Greek cities in their resistance to Rome, when
they called in the help of Pyrrhus; aud it was not till the fau of Tarentum,
Β. c. 272, that these, in common with the other southern states of Italy, final-
ly acknowledged the supremacy of Rome, and accepted their freedom from
her. It was iu consequence of the commandin position of Venusia, in {efer-
ence to the three nations of the Samnites, Apuliam, and Lucaniam, that the
Romans sent there in the above year (B. c. 291) a colony of twenty thousand

defeat of Cannae. The quantity of the second syllable in Venusinua, Horace
makes short here, and in C. i. 28. 26. Juvenal lengthens it (vi. 167) t
“ Malo Venusinam quam te, Cornelia, mater Gracchorum‚’' where, as here,
the humble inhabitant of Venusia is contrasted with the proud mati-on of
ἓοῐὲο. ‘ Quo ne' (v. 37) is an unusual expression, iu which ‘quo' is re-
ant.

wish- He hopes that his adversaries will let him alone, and leave bis sword
(that is, his pen) to nist. me ‘ at ille ’ the construction is a little irregular,
hut the abruptness of the several clauses is well suited to the occasion: ‘ but

47. Chr-vius entus -urnam,] Cervius appears to have been an informer.
He is not the man mentioned in S. ii. 6. 77. ‘ Urnam ' means either the urn
into which the judiees put their tablets, or that into which their names were
put for drawing the jury. Either way it is equivalent to ‘judicium’

Of Scaeva we know nothing. What oraee says is, that he would, like other '

to which cowards have an aversion, but poison.

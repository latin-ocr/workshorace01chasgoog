how willingly he could res-ign them all, even as readily as Telemachus de·
clined the liorses of Menelaus (Odyss. iv. 601, sq).

45. tuomum Tibur] ‘ Vaeuum ' means ‘ idle! YVhether Horace had a
house of his own at Tibur, or not, has been a subject of much discussion; it
m ἑῐέῗωΡιῖιῗιῗὲἳὲῖ th'Tlilsewlff IIPtMarcius Philippus, who was tribunus plebis
Β. c. 104, consul B. c. 81, and censor n. c. 76. He was a very distinguished
man, an eneigetie supportet of the popular cause, a friend of Cn. Pompeius,
and a powerful orator.

47. octavam circiter horam] The following is Martial’s description of the
distribution of a Roman's day ε ·—- The first and second hours were given to
the ‘ salutatiO,’ or reception of elients and visitors. At the third hour the
courts opened and business went on for three hours. The sixth hour was
given up to rest (and the ‘ prandinm’), the seventh to winding up business»,
the eighth to exercise, and with the ninth began dinner. (Mart. iv. 8.) In
{lif main this appears to have been the division of the day in Horaee's time

'ewise.

· 48. Foro nimium distare Gai-iuras] The Carinae was a collection of build-

he farthest part of the arinae could not have been above· three quarters of
a mile from the Forum Romanum; but Philippus was old. Horace means
to show that he was inclined to be peevish, being tired with his work in tho
Forum; and in this splenetic humor, which, if this story be true, had beeome
habitual with him, he fell in with the man Mena, whose easy enjoyment of
life made a strong impression upon him. It made him jealous, and he re-
solved to spoil his independence if he could. ·

50. Adrastum quendum] He had just been shewed, and was paring and l
eleaning his nails leisurely for himself (‘ proprios pu ntem ungues'); he
did not emplo the barber for this operation, us peop e were in the habit of
doing. The s op was empty, because those who would come for business
came early, and those who came to lonnge came later (S. i 7. 3). ‘ Uinbra,’
which here means a shop, is used for different kinds of buildings by the poets,
as a ‘porticus' and a school. See Juvenal (vii. 173): “Ad pugnam qui
rheItorlica descendit ab umbra.'' The shops were open, probably, as they are
· in ta now.

54. {nde domo,] This phrase, which is equivalent to ‘a qua domo,' occurs
in Virgil (Aen. viii. 114) : “ Qui genus‘l unde domo ’ἒ '' Philippus sends to
know who the man is, where he comes from, whether he is rich or poor3 if
‘ingenuus,’ who is his father ; if a freedman, who is his ‘ patronus.'

55. Volteium nomine Menam] This person is represented as a freedman
of some person of the Volteia gens, of which one or two are mentioned in the
Roman writers. A freedman took the Gentile nume of his master on his
manumission. The name Menas is ukin to Menodorus, as Demus to Deme-
trius, Lucas to Lucanus, Silas to Sylvanus, Artemas to Artemius, etc.

56. sine crimine, notum Et] The deseri tion Menas gives of himself is, that
he is a crier of small means, of unblemis ed character, well known as a per-
son who could be active or quiet as the occasion required, and who enjoyed
what he got; one who made himself happy in the company of humble people,
in the possession of a house of his own, at the theatres and Circus, and with
the amusements of the Campus Martius. ‘Et quaerere et uti,’ ‘to get and
to enjoy,' expresses the reverse of him who is ‘nescius uti Compositis ' (S. ii.
3. 109). ‘Lare certo ’ is opposed to a lodging, ‘coenaculum ’ (Epp. i. l. 91,
n.). It appears (v. 65) that he transacted business as a seller ; probably he
had some second-hand things of his own to dispose of. But the ‘ praeco ’ was
not usually the person who managed an ‘aucum' which was presided over by

ODE XVIII.

Tms is a translation or close imitation of an ode of Alcaeus in the same
metr-e, one verse of which is almost literally translated in the first verse of

this Ode, μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότε ν ένδρευν ἀμπέλω. It rofesses
to be addressed to a friend who is ma'ing a plantation near his ouse at
Tibur. The friend‘s name is VaruS, and that was the co nomen of Quinc·
tilius, whose death is lamented in C. 24 of this book. ut whether this
is the person intended or not it is impossible to say, and it does not signify,
since the scene is most probably imaginary. Varus is advised to plant the

‘ vine before all other mee, since wine, if used in moderatiori, drives care

ngy, tifioitilgh ir abused its attendants are strife, sels-love, vainglory, and
ro ‘en ai .

Auernum. - The vine is the first trec thou shouldst plant} VaruS, by
the walls of Tibur. Hardships are only for the sober3 wine drives away
all cares. Who speaks of battles and poverty, rather than of Bacchus and
VenuS, when he is under the influence of wine ² But that no man exceed,
let him think of the bloody frays of the Centaure and Lapithae, and of
the Thraciam, over their cupS, when the appetite confounds right and wrong.
Ι 'll not rouse thee unbidden, beautiful Bassai-eus, nor drag thy myster-ies
from their secret places. Silence the horn and dmm, whose followers me
vainglory and broken saith.

2. muris et moenia attila] See C. i. 7. 13, n. Horace shortens the penulti—
mate syllable of Catillus’s name for the sake of the metro, and the same
liberty is taken with the name of Porsenna, Epod. xvi. 4.

4. aliter] B any other- means than wine, which is not expressed‚ but·
sufficiently im hed in ‘ sic-cis!

6. te potius, A verb must be understood more suitable than ‘ erepat,'

‘ canit ' may be supplied. -

8. super mero} ‘ over their wine,' that is, while they were drinking.
- ⁸ Super' with the ablativo generally means ⁸ about,’ ⁶ on behalf σίζ’ οι· ⁶ con-
eeming,' a thing3 but it is also used to express time„as in Aen. ix. 61 wo

rithouS, king o the Lapithae, the Centaure, being guests, attempted in their
drnnkenness to carry off the bride, Hippodamia, and the other women
present, which led to a battle, in which the Centaurs were beaten.

9. Sithoniis non levis Euius‚] The Sithonians were a people of Thrace, on
the ‘borders of the Euxine. Bacchus was angi-y with the Thraciam, and
visited habitual drunkenness upon them, because their king, Lycurgum, for-
bade the cultivation of the vine. See C. i. 27. l, sq.

10. Cum-fas atque nefas] ‘ Cum ' refers to ‘ super mero! ‘When the
greedf oswine distinguish between right and wrong by the slender line os
their usts,’ that is, the slender distinction that lust so inflamed ean draw. .

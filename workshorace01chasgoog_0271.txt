the ‘ dolium,’ the larger vessel ln which it was put to ferment when new.
The name of the wine is applied to the vessel containing it here, as in
‘ Graeca testa’ (i. 20. 2); ‘Laestrygonia amphora’ (iii. 16. 34). Sabine
wine was not among the best, nor was it of the worst sort. It was a swect
wine, and probably after four years' keeping was in its prime. Horace calls
it elsewhere (C. i. 20. 1) “ vile Sabinum‚” but that was as compared with
Maecenas's more expensive sorta. ’

14. Fors] ‘Chaucess Cic. (de Legg. ii. 11) distinguishes ‘Fors ’ from
‘Fortuna ’ thus: “ Fortuna valet in omnes dies; Fors in quo incerti casus
significantur magis.'’ ‘ Fors ' and ‘ Sors ' differ as cause and effect. See
S. i. l. 1. ‘ Quem dierum cunque ’ is equivalent to ‘ quemcunque diem’ ;
. ‘ whatever day chance shall bestow!

lucro Appone,] ‘ set it down to good luck.’ Cic. Div. 9.17: “de‘ lucro
prope jam quadriennium novimus,'’ i.e. of good luck and contrary to ex-
pectation. Liv. (xi. 8) has the same expression: “De lucro vivere me
scito.” ‘ Lucrari ’ is said of things gained without our own effott, according
to Forcellini's explanation. .

17. virenti] Epod. 13. 4: “dumque virent genua.” ‘The Greeks used

, γόνυ χλωρον. ‘ Virere’ is also applied to old age, and we speak com-

monly of a ‘ green old age! “ Cruda ac viridis senectuS,’' Tac. Agr. 29.

18. areae] Courts and open places about the temples and in different
parts of the town, used as promenades and for games. ‘ Any place in a city
not built upon,' is the jurists’ definition of ‘ area.’

24. male pertinace} ‘ slyl obstinate‚’ or ‘ not obstinate‚’ that is, which does ‘

not resist the snatching of t e ring3 for ‘ male ’ may be taken in either sense.

ODE X.

IN the following Ode, which is a translation or close adaptation of one
written by AlcaeuS‚ the attributes and legends belonging to Hei-mm, the
Greek divinity, are applied to MercuriuS‚ the Latin, who was properly the
god who presided over commerce. Ovid gives much the same account of
Mercurius in the fifth book of the Fasti (663, sqq.). His description begins
with the same apostrophe as this, ‘ Clare nepos Atlantis! -

Aaoumnnr.—Mercury, thou who in their infancy didst tame the human
race by the gifts of speech and the palaestra, of thee will I sing, thou mes-
senger of the gods, thou master of the lyre and prince of thieves. Why,
while Apollo was threatening thee for stealing his cows, he turned and
laughed to find his quiver gone. By thee Priam passed through the Grecian
camp. Thou conductest souis to their last home, thou favorite of the gods

, above and gods below!

SATIRE VIII.

This Satire represents a dinner given b a rich vulgar man to Maeccnas and
five of his friendS. There is not so much to distinguish itin the wa of hu-
mor us the subject admitted of. Few subjects present more scope or face-
tious satire than the airs of low-born men, lately become rich, aping the ways
of the fashionable world, and making wealth their one passport into what is
called good society. This is a very slight sketch, and some of the force even
of this is perhaps-lost through our ignorance of little points of etiquette and
culinary refinements observed by the Romans of that day. ,

The host's name is Nasidienus Rufus. Who he was», it is impossible to

sa .

{netem of telling the story himself, though it is probable from the tone of
the Satire that he writes from a scene he had witnessed, Horace puts it into
the mouth of his friend FundaniuS, the comio writer mentioned in S. i. 10.
42, where see note.

1. Nasidieni] See Introduction. The third and fourth syllables coalesco.
‘ Beati’ means wealthy and favored of fortune. Sec C. i. 4. 14, n.

2. ltere] ‘ Heri ’ is a dative form, ‘hero’ an ablativc3 so we have ‘mani’
and ‘mane’ in the morning, ‘vesperi' and ‘vespere' in the evening. The
termination in ‘i ’ is the older of the two, and it would seem as if the usage
of the word was in a state of transition at this time.

3. De medio potare dia] Nasidienus dincd early, to make the most of his
feast. But ‘medio die’ need not be taken quite literally. The ‘prandium ’
was usually taken at. noon. The dinner-hour was later. (See C. i. 1 . 20, n.)
Busy men, as we saw iu S. 7. 33, sat down by candle—light. ‘De medio die ’
is like ‘de nocte’ in Epp. i. 2. 32, ‘media de luce,’ Epp. i. 14. 34. ‘De'
means ‘after,' that is, ‘de medio die' means ‘after midday'3 but it must
note proximi to midday, or it would have no meaning at all.

4. faerit m ina] See S. 6. 4, n. ‘I never was better off in my life! He
says this ironically, or with reference to the amusement he had got from the
vulgarity of Nasidienus.

Da, st yrave non est,] There is a like use of ‘ darc ’ in Virgil (Ecl. i. 19),
“sed tamen iste Deus qui sit da, Tityre, nobiS.’' Terence also uses it:
“Nunc quam ob rem has partes didicerim paucis dabo '' (Heaut. Prol. 10).
Froegi the meaning of this word, ‘to put,’ this application of it is easily de·
nv .

5. iratum ventrem placaverit] Compare S. 2. 18: “ Latrantem stomachum.'’
Both passages put together suggest the idea of a sop thrown to an angry dog
to keep him quiet. Perhaps that notion, or something of the sort, suggested
this ine.

6. Lucanus aper-ss See S. 3. 2343 4. 42, n. No mention is made of a
‘promulsis ' (S. i. 3. 6, n.)‚ and the things of which it was usually in a great
measure composed were sent up in the same dish with the boar, which was
generally served whole, and was the chief dish, ‘caput coenae.³ Turnips,
lettuces, radishes, parsnips, with pickles and sauccs of various descriptione
(see S. 4. 73, n.)‚ generally formed part of the ‘gustus' or ‘promulsis’
which preceded the ‘fercula‚' or courses of which the regular ‘coena ' con-

sisted. The boar was killed, the host (called ‘coenae pater' with a sort of “

mock respect) informeaeilgis gaesus, when the south wind was not at its worst.

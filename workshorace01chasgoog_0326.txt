4. invidia major] Horace was not too good to be maligned‚ but he could
rise above it, which is the meaning of ‘ major,' κρείσσων. His birth drew
contempt upon him while hc held a command in Brutus's army, and after-
wards when he became intimate with Maecenas (see Sat. i. 6. 46, sqq.) ; but
those who envied tried as usual to make use of him (see Sat. ii. 6. 47, sqq.).

16. H boreasque campos.] There was a mystery attached to the distant
regions o the north, to which Pindar (Pyth. x.) says no man ever found the
way by land or sea. They did not however neglect the Muses. They were
a happy race‚ ἀνδρῶν μακάρων ὅ λοςς a sacred famil , ῖερὰ γενεά, free

-fore‚ there is any distinction between them, etymology does not help us to de-
termine it.

5. meditans] ⁴ Inserere ' may be governed by ‘ audiar,' or ‘ meditans,' or
both. ‘ Meditariss which is akin to μελετᾶν, signifies ‘to revolve in the mind,'
and osten ex resses the giving utterance to that which the mind has conceived.
Here it has e same meaning as Virgil’s “ musam meditaris avena‚'’ “ me-
ditaris arundine musam.''

7. Dicam insiyne] ‘Aliquid ' or ‘ carmen ' must be supplied.

9. Eat-romnis stupet Euius] This name for the attendants on Bacchus, like
Euius, his own name (C. i. 18. 9; ii. 11. 17), is derived from εὗοῖ (Enoc, C.
ii. 19. 7), the bacchanal cry. The Euiad catches ins iration by looking out
from the hill-tops upon the haunts of the god, and so the poet turns aside from
his wonted path to the river-banks and groves where Bacchus is found. The
picture of the Euiad looking out with silent awe, through a moonlight winter’s
night, upon the quiet plains of Thrace, and drawing inspiration from contem·
plating the scenes that her deity frequenta, is very beautiful.

ll. pede barbaro] This refers to the troops of Maenads (Μαινάδες from

ἱαίνοέιαι, as Θυιάδες from θύειν, C. i. 17. 23, n.) celebrating the orgies of
εἷς. ulsiiaeodopeml This was a lofty chain which formed the western boundary
of Thrace proper, and in which the Hebrus took its rise.

ut mihi] The word that usually follows ⁴ aeque ' is ‘ ac.’ But Horace has
‘aeque ut ’ (C. i. 16. 7 -9), and other writers have ‘ pariter ut‚' ‘ non minus
ut ' <Prop. i. 15. 7), ⁸ perinde ut‚' which are analogous to ‘ non secus ut? Of
this there seems to be no other instance, but perhaps ‘ ut' is used in prefer·
ence to ‘ ac,' because that word occurs in the line before.

14. Naiadum gorens Baccharumque] These are the Nymphs mentioned, C.
ii. 19. 3. The acchae, as distinguished from the Natades‚ are the wood-
nymphs (Dryades). ’

19. Lenaee,] This is a name os Bacchus derived from ληνὸς, a wine-press.

203tem {cet pompina] Compare C. 1v. 8. 33: “Ornatus viridi tempora
pampino r.

ODE XXVI.

Tms Ode represents a successful gallant’s first refusal, and his mortifica-
tion and wrath at his defeat. It is a purely fanciful composition.

“ Militiae species amor est, discedite segnes ” (A. A. ii. 233) ; ‘⁴ Militat omnis
amans et habet sua castra Cupido ’' (Am. i. 9. 1). The arms this lover pro-
poses to hang up in the temple of Venus on the left wall, as being most pro·
pitious (but see next Ode, v. 15, n.), are the torch that lighted him to his
mistress, the erowbar that broke open her door, and the bow and arrows which

he carried as emblems of his passion perhaps. For what other purpose he
could use them it is not easy to see.

5. minae] See C. i. 3 1, n.

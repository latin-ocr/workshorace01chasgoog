15. patiarque vel inconsultus haberi-J See C. ii. 7. 283 iii. 19. 18.

16. ‚Quid non ebrietas‘ desiynat ἲ] ‘ Designat' is to do anything out of the
way, as in Terence (Adelph. i. 2. 6): a f ⁸

Omitto: modo quid designav3?aeBZ?taQffigham id est?

De. Fores effregit atque in aedes irruit.’'
Horace sayS, ‘ What strange things will not ebriety do ’ἒ ’ As to ‘ operta re-
cludit,’ compare C. i. 18. 16; iii. 21. 165 Epod. 11. 14 ; and the places
quoted in the note on S. i. 4. 87.

18. addocet artea] That is, mone particularly, the art of speech mentioned
in the next line. ‘Addocet' is an uncommon word, and is like the Greek
προσ-διδάσκει. ε ‘Fecundi calicesf ⁸¹2⁹ fulla-caps, ‘ Contracta paupertas ’
00121ἶὸρὲἓὲεὸ 230-ss&ssssss pfflgepgsseuffibpff. ξω] ,one of the chief slaves,
and general steward. But the ‘promus’ was also called ‘ procurator peni'
(see S. ii. 2. 16), and Horace says he has undertaken or ordered himself to
arrange everything for the dinner. ‘ Haec ' refers to what follows. · He says
he is ‘ idoneus,' competent to the duty, and ‘non invitus,' he likes it. ‘ Im-
peror ' is nowhere else used as it is here. The proper construction is ‘ impe-
ratur mihi! So Horace alone uses ‘invideor' (A. P. 56). As to ‘toral '
and ‘mappa,' see S. ii. 4. 81. 84. ‘Corruget nares' means to make the
guests turn up their noses in disgust.

25. ἀίτηίηεε,] This is an old word for ‘to turn out of doors! Horace
applies it to telling tales out of doorS. Of the guests nothing at all is known.
‘Potior puella’ means one who has more attractions than Horace's dinner.

28. Iocus est et pluribus umbris .·] · Horace says there is room for several

‘umbrae’ (S. ii. 8. 22, n.)‚.that is, four3 for a full ‘triclinium’ held nine -“ ¹

persons. But, considering the heat of the weathcr, he thinks it as well not
to have the full number. ‘ Capra,' ‘caper,’ ‘hircuS,' are all used to signify
the smell from the aim-pits when they pei-spire.

30. Tu quotus esse veles] He had only ·to say how many persons he wished
to have, and leave the rest to the host. Horace advises his friend not to
come out at the front door, ‘ostium,' or ‘janua atriensiS,' for fear he should
find a client waiting to catch him, but at the back door, ‘posticum ostium,’3

which the Greeks called ψευδόθυρον, a false door.

EPISTLE VI.

ρ

W'no Numicius was, nobody can tell, and it is of no imtffmnoe' Any
other name would have done as well. Nothing turns upon e character or·
circumstances of the person nominally addressed. ,

As to the design of the Epistlc, it is to support virtue, under the aspect of
a calm sels-content as the chief good. The ordinary standards of happiness
are treated with contempt, and there is a strong vein of irony running through
the greater part of the Epistle.

1. Nil admirari] It is sslf-control, or the power of keeping the mind in an
equable frame, that Horace says is the only means of making a man happy
and keeping him so. ‘ Nil admirari’ can only be said to be necessary to this
rule when admiration amounts to a stupid wonder, excessive fear, excitement,
or other effects by which the judgment is misled and the passions- roused in·-
juriously. As to ‘px-ope,' see S. ii. 3. 32, n.

4. sant qui formidine nulla] ‘ Formido ' is here equivalent to semianimis

ODE XII.

This Ode is addressed to Maecenati, and, from the language of it, we might
suppose he had asked Horace to write something on a highcr subject than he
was accustomed to. Horace tells him that his lyre is not suited to ware and
triumphs, but he loves to sing of the beauty of Licymnia, under which name

Artemam·- —Do not ask me with my soft lyre to sing of bloody wars,
of centanis, and of giants: as for the triumphs of Caesar, MoecenaS, thou
couldst tell them better in prose than Ι can in verse. · My task is to sing of
the beaut and faithfulness of Licymnia, who graces the dance and sports
with the amsels on Diana’s holidav. Wouldst thou, for all the wealth of

{imin} Phrygia, and Arabia, give ἷι lock of Licymnia's hair, or one of her
sses .

l. Numamiaa] The siege of Numantia, in Spain, by the Romane,1asted,
like that of Troy, for ten years, when it was finished by Scipio Africanus
Minor, who took the city Β. c. 133. The bravery with which the Numan·
tines behaved earned them from their enemies the title ‘ feri,’ ‘ savage.'

2. dirum Hannibalern,] This epithet is found three times in this eonnec-
tion. See C. iii. 6. 363 iv. 4. 42.

Siculum mare] Alluding to the naval victories of Duilius, Metellae, and
Lutatius Catulus, in the first Punic war (see C. iii. 6. 34).

5. nimium mm] This use of ⁴ nimium' is common in Tacitae, who also
uses it with a genitive, as (Hist. iii. 75), “nimius sermonis erat.” Hylaeus
was a centaur. As to the Lapithae, see C. i. 18. 8.

7. Telluris juvenes] The Gigantes, who were called γηγενεῖς, ‘ earth-born,'
made war upon Zeus, and were destroyed by him with the help of HerculeS,
and the bow and arrows given him by Apollo. Horace gives Bacchus the

eredit of their defeat in C. ii. 19. 21, sqq„ and Pallas in Ο. iii. 4. 57, where
Hercules is not mentioned.

So τε often follows οὔτε, the fact being that eve negative proposition may
be resolved into an affirmative with a negation. ere the connection is be-

indifferent one3 and Horace may have put off his requcst that he should
write a poetical account of Augustus’s achievements, by suggesting that ho

Ἀφροδίτη. Venus„ is called Eycina, from Mount Eryx in Sicily, where
she had a temple. Ῑμερος and Epeos· (two forms of Love) were the sons of

38. leves, ‘ Polished ’ or ‘ burnished.’ ·

39. Mauri peditis] Translate in the following order: ‘ et Vultus Mauri
peditis Acer in cruentum hostem? The force of ‘ peditis ’ here appears to be

i that the rider has had his horse killed under him, or has dismounted to

attack his enemy hand to hand, or in consequence of a wound. See S. ii.
l. 13 t “ Aut labentis equo describit vulnera Parthi? The troops of Mauri-
tania were chiefly cavalry. There is a particular meaning in the reference
to them rather than to any other troopS.

41. juvenem] So Augustus is called, though he was forty years old at this
time. So Viifi. (Georg. i. 500) Ξ -—

“ une saltem everso juvenen succurrere saeclo
Ne prohibete.'’
See C. iii. 14. 93 Epp. i. 8. 14 ; and S. ii. 5. 62, where the word is again
applied to Augustus.

‘ J uvenis ' and ‘ adolescens ' were used for any age between ‘ pueritia' and
‘ senectus! Cicero speaks of himself as ‘ adolescens ’ at the time he put
down Catiline's conspirac , when he was forty-four years old, and as ‘ senex '
when he delivered his 2d hilippic, at which time he was sixty-tWO.

42. Ales] Agreeing with ‘ Filius!

43. Filius] Is the nominative used for the vocative. — ‘ Patiens vocari,'

pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari '’ (Epp. i. 16. 30).

45. Serus in caelum redeas] ovid, Met. xv. 868, sqq. :—

“ Tarda sit illa dies et nostro serior aevo
Qua caput Augustum, quem temperat orbe relicto,
· Accedat caelo.'’
See also Trist. v. 2. 47. The adjective for the adverb is common in respect
of time. The instances in Horace are very numerous,

brate, three triumphs on three successive days, for his victories, (1.) over the
Gauls, Pannonians, and DalmatianS, (2.) at Actium, and (3.) at Alexandria.
‘ Triumphos ' is governed by ‘ames,’ as ‘ pocula ’ is governed by ‘ spernit’
(i. 1. 19) ; in both which cases we have an accusative case and an infinitivo
meod governed by the same verb.

50. pater] The title of ‘ ater patriae ’ was not assumed by Augustus till

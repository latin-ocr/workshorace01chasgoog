ODE X.

Iucu-uus Munium, or A. Terentius Varro Murena, as hc was called aster
his adoption by A. Terentius Varro, was apparently a man of restless and
ambitione character, and, as we have seen, paid the penalty of his rashness
with his life (C. ii. 2. 5). It is very probable that Horace wrote this Ode to
his friend to wam him of the tendencies of his disposition, and to recommend
to him the virtue of moderatiori. All else thatwe leam from Horace's poema

their way to Brundisium (S. i. '5. 37, sq.). party on

monumen—The way to live, Licinius, is neither rashly to tempt nor
cowardly to fear the -storm. The golden mean secures a man at once from
the pinching of povert and the envy of wealth. The lostiest objecta fall
soonest and most beavi y. In adversity or prosperity the wise man looks for
change. Storms come and go. Bad times will not continue for ever. Apollo
handles the lyr-e, as well as the bow. In adversity show thyself bravo, in

prosperity take in sail.

5. Auream quisquis] ⁴ Whoso loves the golden mean (between poverty and
immense riches), is safe and free from. the squalor of a crazy roos, is sober
and free from the envy of a palace?

6. obsoleti] That which has gone out of use; therefore, old and deeayed.
This word has various applications. ,

14. Alteram sortem] '1‘ss object of ‘metuit’ and ‘ sperat!

“ Cras vel atra

17. olim Sic erit.- quondam cithara] ‘ Olim,’ being derived stom the 'demon-
strative pronoun ‘ illo‚’ of which the older form is ⁴ 610: or ‘ ollo‚' and which
only indicates the remoter object, significa some time more or less distant,
either· in the past or future. So likewise ‘ quondm‚' which is akin to
‘ quum,’ au adverb relating to all parts of time, signifies any time not pres-
ent. Translate herc, ‘at times.’

Apollo is almost always represented with a bow and arrowS, or a lyr-e, or
both. Homer has many epithets describiug him with his bow. The ancients
believed him to be the punisher of the wicked aud the author of all sudden
deaths among men, as Diana (Artemis) was among women. He was the
god of music, but got his-lym from Mercury (C. i. 21. 12, n.).

186. Aut ursum aut puyiles ,·] Augustus himself had a liking for boxers, as
mentioned on Epp. i. 1. 49. The intemxptions to the regular drama which
Horace here mentions appear to have been of common occurrence. Though
the acting of plays was in Horace’s time carried on in a theatra (v. 60, n.)
erected for this special purpose, it appears the people insisted sometimes ou

having a bear-hait or a boxingqnatch there to amase them, in spite of the ·

remonstrances of the equites in the front rows, wh0‚ however, Horace sa s,
were themselves taken too much with processione and shows that appealyed
‚more to the eye than to the ear.

187 . Verum equitis} ⁴ But with -the eques, too, all his pleasure was shifted
from the ear to the erring eye and vain delights.’‘' He means that the eye is
easily dazzled and deluded. The ear takes in what it receives, and conveys
it to the mind without error.

189. aulaea premuntur] At the back of the stage was the ‘scena,' or wall
on which was painted some scene suitablc to the performance. Before this
‘scena ’ was a curtam, which was let down below tho stage when the acting
ἔξω, and raised when it was over. This curtain was called ‘aulaeum.’

e raising of the curtain at the end of the play is referred to in A. P.

” 192. Εεεοᾱαίωτίπαηῃ The ‘essedum ' was originally the name of a Brit-
ish or Gaulish war-chariot, derived from a Celtic root. The name came to
be applied to a travelling carriage on two wheels and drawn by two horseS.
The ‘pilentum ’ was a carl-iage used in processionS‚ and ap ars to have been.
usually of a luxurious kind, with well-staffed cushions‚ an used by women.
It wsss also a travelling carriage. As to ‘petorritum,' see S. i. 6. 104, 11.,

’ 193Ρ1ιζαριίυα Corinthus] The taking of Corinth may have been represented
by spoils 'of Corinthian bronze.

194. Democritus,] See Epp. i. 12. 12, n. Democritus had the character of
a laughing philosopher, one who turned things habitually into ridicule.

196. Sive elephas albus] The king of Ava has for one of his man titles
the Lord of the White Elephant3 and it has been usual for the Britis gov-
ernment‚ when an elephant of this color was caught in their territorieS, to ,
send it with due ceremony as a present to his Majesty. White elephants are
merely lusus naturae.- they are not a distinct species, as some have sup osed.
They have ink eyes, like other albinos‚ but do not differ from the grown
animal in ot er respects. They are not common.

both of which were shgl-flsh, found in great abundance on both coasts of taly.

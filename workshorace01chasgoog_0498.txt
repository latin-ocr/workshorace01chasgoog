sumus. — Boon 11. 483

‘ Certum vigilans '' means ‘ wide awake,’ noteonfusedly, as those who aie
half aslee .

— Cluui-'tae sit partis] The ‘ heres ' of one fourth of the property would be
‘ ex quadrante ’ or ‘ex terunciO.' (See note on v. 53, above.) 'Ehe formula
‘in wills was such as this: “ Sola mihi uxor heres esto,'' “ Sempronius ex
parte dimidia heres esto.’'

101. Dama] See v, 18, n. He is to throw in now and then (‘sparge sub-
inde ⁹) a whine for the dear man that is gone, and squeeze out a tear if he

sibl can. '

Ροῗοὲ. yUncle mihi tam finem] This abrupt and elliptieal way of speaking
occurs again below (S. 7. 116) : “ Unde mihi lapidem? Quorsum est opus ’ἓ
'Unde sagittas ’ἕ ” ‘ Parabo ’ may be understood, or some such word.

103. est] This is equivalent to ἔξεστι.

105. Permissum arbitrio] A sum of money was generally named in the
will for the funeral expenses. Sometimes they appear to have been left ex-

ressly to the judgment and liberality of the ‘ heres ' or ‘heredesj as here. ,
gut if no mention was made of this subject in the will, or if a man died intes·
tate, those who succeeded to the property were bound to provide all that was
decent for his intermeat. As to ‘ funuS, see note on S. i. 6. 43. See C. i. 9.

108. seusandi sive dotans sit E mptum] ‘ Fundus ’ is a lauded estate together
with the buildings upon it. ‘ Domus,' therefore, which is opposed to ‘fun-
dus ' here, and in Epp. i. 2. 4⁷, may mean a town-house. The advice is, that
isone of the man’s ‘ coheredeS,' who is old, and by afflad cough shows he is
near his end, expresses a wish to have an estate or house which forms part of
his share, he should declare himself delighted to make it over to him for a
nominal price, a single ‘ sestertius! This would be a bold geme, but he
might hoHe that such generosity on his part would be remembered in the sick
man's wi .

109. addicere] This is a legal ,term used in selling, “and signifies the
declaration of him who sells as to the transfer of the thing to the buyer.”
(Long, Vei-r. ii. 2. 32.) It was used in rivate bargains as here, and at pub-

lic auctions it was the word used for decssnng who was the purchaser.

 

SATUJE VI.

11< this Satire, Horace dwells upon the inconveniences of a town life and
the delights of the country, the former as connected with the importunity of
people asking for his influence with Maecenas, or for information upon public
affairs of which he knows nothing, though they will not believe it. The sub-

‘ ject is illustrated by the story of a town and a country mouse. The town
meuse visits the country mouse, and, taunting him with his seclusion, tempta
him to accompany him to town, and then entertains him at a rich man's
table. · But the servantS, coming in suddenly-at daybreak, frighten them
both out of their wits, and the country mouse goes home again, resolving to

keep to his own quiet hole in the fields, and try the town no more.

1. non ita maynus‚] Compare with these lines C. iii. 16. 29, sqq. ‘Mo- -
dus ’ is used for any uantity. r

water, and a d spring of this would bc of great value to the property. l
3. super ln's ‘ Besides these.’ In this sense, ‘ super' usually governs the
accusative. ‘ Super ’ is used absolutely in this sense of ‘more,’ as in Epod.

were more licentious and scurrilem, and satires got the same name, but the
sort of poetry with which it originated was harmless, as Horace says. Com-

152. quin aiam lex Poenaque lata] See S. ii. 1. 80, n. ‘Lata’ properly
belongs to ‘ lex! When a penalty was inserted in the ‘ lex‚’ it was ‘ lex
sancta,' as stated in the note just resen-ed to.

154. Describi,·] This is used in the same sense in S. i. 4. 3: “ Siquis
erat dignus describi.’' ‘Fustuarium’ was a mode of putting to death by
beating with sticks and stoning, usuali , bnt not only, as the passage showS,
inflicted on soldiers. (See Dict. Antt.

156. Graecia serum victorem cepit] The taking of Syracuse by Mar-
celluS, B. c. 212, e seventh year of the second Punic war, led to the intro-
duction into Rome of a teste for Greek art, many fine works being at that

time first made known to the Romans. In B. e. 146, the last year of the
third Punic war, Corinth was taken by Mummius, and Seuthem Greece was
formed into the Roman province of Achaia. Horace had probably both
these periods in his mind, as well as the conquest of Southern Italy, iu the
towns of which were some of the (inest works of Grecian art. The first play
copied from the Greek was not exhibited at Rome till after the first Punic
war, which ended in n. c. 241. It was by Livius. See v. 62, n.

158. Defluoeifnumerus Saturnius] The Saturnian verse, according to Nie-
buhr (i. 259, n.), continued in use till about n. e. 100. Horace says traces
of the old rudeness remained in his day, ffiombly in the less polished
‘mimes,’ and in the ‘ Fescennina earmina, w 'ch were not extinct-

161. Serus enim] ‘ Romanus must be understood here.

168. Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus] Thespis is here introduced as
being the reputed founder of Greek tragedy. It is doubtful whether any of
his plays were translated by or known to the Roman tragedians, of whom
Horace has mentioned Livius, Ennius, Naevius, Pacuvius, and Accius, We
know of no others earlier than Accius, the last of these; and the number of

Horace says comedy is gfpposed to be very easy, because the matter is eom:
mon3 but, in fact, it gives more trouble in proportion to the readiness with
which it is criticised and faults are detected and condemned. The following
remarks on the stage grew out of the allusion to the Greek writers, but they
annot closely connected with what is passed. They are introduced for the
purpose of deprecating the excessive admiration and support bestowed on the
. drama at the expense of other etry (168 - 213).

170. Plautus] It appears t at Horace had no great opinion of Plautus,

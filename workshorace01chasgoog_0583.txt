145. Antiphaten Namque] These are all stories from the Od .
Antiphates was king of the Laestry ones, a. gigantic race in Sicily, w o de-
voured three of the companions 01· lysses‚ 01111 destroyed his ships (x. 80,

146. Nec reditum Diomedis] This was related in a Cyclic poem called
Νόστοι. Meleager, who was one of the Argonauta, and was still more famous
for the destruction of the 11001· sent b Diana to vex the inhabitants of Caly-
don in AEtolia, was uncle to Diomedy,⁷ being brother to Tydeus. The cause

mother, Althaea, for the slaughter of her two brothers (Il. ix. 567, sqq.),- and
her Erinnys pursued him to his death. But as this was before the Trojan
war, and had nothing to do with it, to begin 011 account of Diomed's return
with an account of his uncle’s death would be absurd enough. It would
seem as if some poet had been guilty of this absurdity.

148. ὑι medias να] The ancients appear particularly to have remarked
this quality of Homcr's poema. See Quintil. vii. 10. 11 : “ubi ab initiis in-

neuter pronoun ‘id,') differs from ‘sic,’ ‘so‚' as the logical ‘i' or ‘eo,’ ‘ this,’
differs from the demonstrative ‘ho,' ‘ this? '’ ‘Ita,’ therefore, is the usual
word with ‘ut' following. But the poets (and sometimes even the prose-
writcrs) use ‘sic' in 1110 same construction, and in others in which ‘ 1ta’ is
more usual. Compare C. i. 8. 1, “ Sic te Diva potens Cypri ”; and Epp. i.

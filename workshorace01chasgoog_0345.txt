ODE XI.

Tms is an address to the lym, calling upon it for a song to win the heart
of Lyde. The principal subject is the story of the DanaideS, who murdered
their husbands, but more particularly of the one who spared hers. The pun-
ishment of the sisters for their cruelty, and the tenderness of Hypermnestra,
are the warning and example by which Lyde is to be won.

The common inscription An Mencnnmu is wrong, and calculated to mis-
lead. The inscription should be An Tns‘runlm-:M‚ if anything3 for Mercury
disappears after the first two verses, The miracles alluded to, except Am-
phion'S, were those of Orpheae, and of the l in his hande, not Mercury’8‚
who is only introduced because he invente the lyre and taught Amphion.
The Ode is of the same class as the two last. We have no means of tracing
the original, if it is a copy.

3. Tuque testudo] See C. i. 10. 6, n. The ‘testudo’ or ‘cithara’ had origi-

The tetrachord was not however banished‚ though the heptachord was better
adapted to more elaborate music (see S. i. 3. 8, ιι).

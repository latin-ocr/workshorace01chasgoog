2e. Non qui Sidonio] On the position of ‘non‚’ see S. i. 6. ῑ. ‘Not be
who knows not skilfully to compare with Sidoniau purple the wool that
drinks the dye of Aquinum, shall suffer harm more certain or more deep
thau he who cannot tell truth from falsehood.’ There is strong irony in
these words, and they follow naturally on what goes before, as representing
the paltry ob'ects with which the mind is employed in what is called fasliion-
able life, to t e destruction of the moral sense.

The foreign put-ples (enumerated on C. ii. 16. 36) were most esteemed‚
and these were imitated by the Italians (see Epp. ii. l. 207). The ‘ fucus ’
was a mariue plant of some kind, which yielded a red juice used for coloring.
It was commonly used in imitation of the real dyo. Hence it came to be
used for deception in general. Aquinum (Aquino), the birth-place of Juve-

34. Can-¹132 equum pugna melior] Stesichorus is said to have spoken this
fable to the citizens of Himera, when they were preparing to confer absolute
mei· on Phalaris, and give him a body-guard. The fable is told by Phae-

(iv. 4), with the substitution of a boar for the stag.

3⁷. Sed postquam victor violens] ‘ Violens ' expresses the struggle with
which the horse won his victory and his servitude.

36. potiore metallis] The ‘vectigalia' fnom mines (‘metalla') were very
considerable at this time. The principal mines were the gold of Aquileia
and Ictimuli in the Alps, and the silver οἰ Spain.

and seems to have been identical with Victoria.

 

EPISTLE XI.

Tms Epistle is addressed to one Bullatius, of whom we know nothing at
all. He was travelling in the AEgean and in Asia Minor, and was absent
longer than Horace wished, or thought good for him 3 aud the object of this
letter is to induce him to return. ·

1. Quid tibi viba Chios, The island of Chios was rugged and mountain-
ouS, but had, as it stil has, an excellent climate and choice wines3 its
women also were very haudsome: in all of which particulare ancient and

adorned with buildings and works of art. Not a traee of an ing re- ⁵

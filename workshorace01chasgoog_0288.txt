too, with 811 his learning, hath gone down once more to the grave. But so
it is: all must die alike 3 some tn make :port for Mars; some swallowed up
in the deep: old and young go crowding to the grave : none escape : I, too,

of earth: so may the storm spend itself on the woodS, 'while thou art safe,

1. Te maris et ten-ae] ‘ Te ’ is emphatic, ‘ even thee,' as the abruptness of
the opening requires. ἄμμον ετρεῖν, κύματα μετρεῖν, were proverbial ex-
pressions for lost labor. ,See org. ii. 104, sqq. ε -

“ Neque enim numero comprendere refert3
Quem qui scire velit, Lib ci velit aequoris idem
Dicere quam multae Zep yro turbentur arenae.'’

Archimedes wrote a work, ὁ ψαμμίτης, 111 which he computed the grains o'f
saud on the shores of Sicily, and it may be alluded to here. There is no
reason to sup se that Archytas ever attempted to solve any such problem.

2. Arclqta, Archytas was a native of Tarentum, born towards the end
of the fifth century n. c. He was for a long time the leading man in that
{lmefsszlssfflaettssfflgffi {uffhssssssfflssssnffissia‘sse ‘mm ξέἑῗῖἱὲξι
this passage, that there was a legend to the -effect that Archytas was buried
on the shore under the promonotory of Matinum, running out from the range
called Mons Garganus, in Apulia. Possibly, a tomb was shown there as his.
That Arch was shipwoecked on a voyage down the Adriatic, (which is
the genera opinion‚) cannot be roved from this Ode.

3. parva—Manem,] ‘a smal portion? ‘Munus’ seems to contain the
same clement as μοῖ . It is not properly equivalent to ‘ donum.’

7. Pelo is qenitcr, See C. 6. 8, 11.

8. wlssnoe] He was the husband of Aurora, carried by her into heaven,
on her golden chariot (Eur. Tro. 852).

9. Minos] Called by Hom. (Odyss. xix. 149) Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής,
the grandson of him who became jud in HadeS. .

10. Panthoiden] The story allude to is that of Pythago who, to prove
his doctrine of metempsychosis, declared that he had been EffiorbuS, the son
of PanthouS, who fell 111 the Trojan war. In support of whigx he claimed as
his own a shield h‘un'g up in the temple of June at ArgOS, which, when taken
down, proved to have the name of Euphoxffius engraved on it. .

11. quamvis] “ Tacitus and the later writers use ⁸ quamvis ' with an indic-
ative, and, vice versa, “quanquam ' with a subjunctive.” (Key’s Gram. 1227,
1111010.) The prose-wnters of Homce's time would not use ⁶ quamvis ’ with
an indicative3 and he uses the subjunctive where the caseis strictly hypo-
thetical, as C. iv. 2. 39, or where it suits the mette, as C. iv. 6. 7.

14. -Judice te] Asch *tas professed to follow the doctrines of Pythagoras.

non. sordidus auctor atur-ae verique] i. e. ‘ no mean teacher of truth‚ phys-
ical and moral,' or, as we should say, ⁴ no mean authority ’ on such subjects.

’ ‘ Auctor' is one whose evidence may be relied upon.

17. Furiae] This name represents the Greek notion of the Erinnyes, as

Ποῖνάι, or Ἀραί, the divinities which executed vengeance on the guilty, and
in that character stit-red up strife, as here represented. So Virgil (Aen. iv.

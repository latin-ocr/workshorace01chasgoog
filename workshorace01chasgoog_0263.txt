25. Audax οιηηία perpeti& ‘ Presumptuous (enough) to endure all suffer·
· ings.' Compare with this ph. Antig. 332, sqq. :—

πολλὰ τὰ δεινὰ, κούδὲν ἀν·

θρώπου δεινότερον πέλει.

τοῦτο καὶ πολιοῦ πέραν

ποντου χειμερίῳ νότῳ

χωρεῖ, περιβρυχίοισιν

περῶν ὑπ’ οἴδμασιν.
‘ Pei-peti ' means to endure to the end. ‘ Vetitum’ with ‘ nefas ’ is not alto-
gether redundant. It expresses crimes which are obviously forbidden, as

shown by the obstructions thrown in the way of their commission.
27. Iapeti penus] ‘ Son of Iapetus ' (Prometheus). This is after the use

of γένος, which occurs not rarely in the Tragedians. Eurip. (Cyclops 104)

has δριμὺ Σισύφου γένος, for Ulysses; and Virg. (Aen. iv. 12) “genus esse
Deorum.’' Compare S. ii. 5. (ia—Prometheus also claimed to be the in-
ventor of ships (Aesch. P. V. 467).

28. fraude mala] ‘ Mala ' means mischievous οι· fatal theft, referring to
its consequences. Teehnically ‘ dolus malus ’ means a fraud with bad intent,
and. ‘ dolus bonus ' with good intent, a pious fraud.

30. Subduc-tum] ‘ stolen.’ ‘ Sub ’ in composition has sometimes that
force of ὑπό which signifies ‘ suppression,’ and so ‘ deception ’ in every form.
But it does not always eonvey a bad meaning.

31. incubuit] This word. does not always take a dative case after it.
Lucret. vi. 1141 ε -

“ Mortifer aestus —
Incubuit tanden populum Pandionis omnem.’' , Α
In what follows ‘ prius ’ belongs to ‘ semoti,' and ‘ tarda necessitas leti ' ane
one subject. Translate, ‘ tardaque necessitas leti, prius semoti, corripuit
gradum‚' ‘ the power, once slow, of death remote before, hastened its step.’
So that ‘prius ' also affects ‘ tarda? The story of the diseases and ills which
issued from Pandora’s heic, and which were a punishment for the theft of
PrometheuS, will be found in any classical dictionary. ·

36. Herculeus lab-l So Odyss. xi. 600, βιή Ἡρακληείη for Hercules.
“ Catonis virtus '³ (C. iii. 21. 11), ‘⁶ virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli '’
(S. ii. 1. 72), may be taken in the same way. The deseent of Hercules to

Hades‚ for the purpose of bringing up Cerberum, was the twelfth labor im-
posed on him by Eurystheus.

 

ODE IV.

L. Susum, whose name is used in this Ode, was one of those who served
with Horace under BrutuS‚ and they were no doubt on terms of¹ intimacy.
The Ode professes to be written at the beginning of spring, and its subject
is the uncertainty of life and the duty of enjoying it.

Ancum-mr.— The winter is thawing3 the spring is returning3 the ships
are being launched ; the herds quit their stalls and the plouohman his fire-
side 3 and the meadows are no longer white with frost. {fenus and the
Graces are leading the dance, and the Cyclops’ forge is buming. ⁴Let us bind
the head with myrtle or the earth’s first flowem, and sacrifice a lamb or kid
to Pan. Death calls on rich and poor alike. Life is short, Ο Sestius! and
our ho es we must contract. The grave awaits thee; and when there, no
more s alt thou preside at the feast, or sigh for the fair young Lycidas.

were, as might be expected, usually persons of no credit. The shops were

ditty, and the company very low. Compare Epp. i. 14. 21.. There were

great numbers ofthese shops about the city. They were also called ‘ ther-

63. duplicis pernoscere juris] Catius goes on to describe the salices, of
which there are two kinds; one which he calls simple, but which was not en-
tirely so, being made of sweet olive-cil mixed with rich wine aud ‘ muria.‚’
which is but ‘garum‚' made from certain eheu-fish (S. 8. 53). There was a
composite sance which was made up of the above boiled with chopped herbe,
with a sprinkling of saffron, and, when it had stood to cool, the finest olive-
oil of Venafrum (C. ii. 6. 16, n. .

66. Β mutia< uit orca.] T e ‘thynnus' fmm which the best ‘garum’
was m e was ound best in the neighborhood of Byzantium (Pliny ix. 20).
‘ Orca’ is a ja‘r used for teser-sing sauces and pickleS. As to the form ‘ pu-
tuit: see S. 3. 194, n. ' he ‘ crocus ' of Mons Corycus in Cilicia appears to
have been most celebrated. ‘ Stetit' means ‘ has ceased to boil?

69. Venafranae] See O. ii. 6. 16, n. '

70. Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia] The apples of Tibur and Picenum have
been referred to before (C. i. 7. 14; S ii. 3 272). ,

71. Venucula convenit ollis ,·] It is not known whence this grape derives
its name. The word is variously spelt. Grapes were dried and preserved
in jars for the winter. For drying in this way, Catius says the grape of the
Alban hills is best. His opinion is not supported by any extant authority,
as it is in the other instance.

73. Hanc eye cum male's‚] Catius says he was the first to introduce Alba-
nian raisins at the second course, and likewise ⁴ faex ² and ‘ allee‚' two pickles,
or two names for the same, being the lees of the ‘ muria ' (ν. 63, n.). Catius
also elaims the merit of introducing little dishes containing a mixture of salt
and white pepper. The object of all this, as well as the pickles‚ was to pro-
mote thirst, and add to the pleasure ofi drinking after dinner. white pepper
is milder than bluck. It is made by blanching the finer grains of the black,
ancl taking off the rind. The ancients must have got their pepper from the
East Indies. The best is grown· on· the Malabar coast.

75. lucr-etum This comes from ‘incerno,' ‘ to sift‚’ or ‘incer-nendo spar-
gcre' (Forcell. , ‘to scatter with a sieve ' or ‘incerniculumss It therefore
means that the peppcr was sprinkled over the salt. ‘ Catillus ' is a diminu-
tive form of ‘ eatinus!

76. millia terna macello] 3,ooo sesterces (npwards of ἑ 26) for a dish of
fish is a large sum, but not perhaps exaggeratcd. Larger sums were given
for dainties. As to ‘ macellum,’ see S. 3. 229, n. By ‘ vagos pisces ' he
means that it is >a sliame to confine in a nan-ow eompass animals that have
had the freedom and range of the scas. The liberty of the bird is expressed
by the same epithet in C. iv. 4. 2. ·

79. caliceml' The slave handing a drinking-cup (‘ calix ³) to a guest, just
after he had been gathering and licking up the remains of the dishes‚ would
leave the marks of his finem-s upon it, and this would turn the stomaehs of
the company, who would a‘lso be diegusted if they saw dirt upon the ‘ cratera '
in which the wine and the water were mixed. The ‘ calix ' was the same as
the Greek κύλιξ. Its shapes and sizes and materiale all varied very much.
There were wooden and earthen-ware ‘ calices‚’ and others of common glasS‚
and others V f greater value of colored glass 3 but those that were most valued
of all were‘ he ‘ crystallina,' of a pure and highly transparent cr stal glass.
The colored glass eups came principally from Alexandria. ‚T e Romans
were carious ln collecting old vessels for their table (veteres-craterae’), as,
obsemd before (S. 3. 21, n.). .

3. affectis] This means ‘when he shall have added) Horaee's object
seems to be to divert mcn's attention from the Parthian prisoners and past
defeat to new objects of hope and ambition, under the guidance of Augustus.
(εἷ ςΙῗαῃιῖἓαἙῦοἨίε epithet is applied to the Parthians before (C. i. 2. 22).

5. Milesne Crassi] It was about twenty-eight years since the disastrous.

campaign of Crassus. Orelli says Horace does not allude to Μ. Antonius’s
losses in the same quarter eighteen years afterward5‚ partly because it would
have· been indelicatefowards AugustuS, and partly because of his affection

7. Pro curia inversique mores l] ‘ Pro ' expresses vehemence varying int

kind according to circumstances. 'It is followed b the nominative or accu-
sative. In the common exclamation, “ Pro deum ominumque fidem Ξ ” the
accusative is always used. The Curia (called Hostilia, because it was said to
have been built by Tullus Hostilius) was the senate-house, and the exclama-
tion in the text is, “ Alas for our senate and our altered manners l ’³

. 8.. in armis] The Roman prisoners may have served in the Parthian
annues,

9. Marsus et Apulus] See C. ii. 20. 18, n. It does not appear that the ,

Apulians were particularly good soldierS, but the states of Italy all furnished
troops (‘ socii ’), and the Roman army is here referred to, Perhaps Horace
added the Apulians to the Marsi through affection for his native state.

10. Aue-iliorum] This genitive, from ‘ ancile,' is anomalous. Forcellini

‚points out a similar irregularity in ‘ Saturnaliorum,’ and Orelli adds ‘ spon-
saliorum? The ‘ancilia' were twelve shieldS, of which, according to tradi-
tion, eleven were made by order of Numa after the pattern of one that was
found in his house, and was supposed to have come down from heaven. It
was prophesied, that while the ‘ ancile ' was ffieserved, Rome should survive.
The ‘ancilia' were kept by the priests of ars (Salii) in his temple. By
‘togae ' is meant his citizenship, since none but Roman citizens wore the
toga. Horace collects the·most distinguished objects of a Roman’s reverence‚
lus name, his citizenship (‘togae '), the shield of MarS, only to be lost, and the
fire of Vesta, only to be extinguished, when Rome should perish.

12.l Incolumi Jove] · That is, ‘ while the Capitol is safe,' which was Jove's
tem e.

Ιξ. exemplo trahentis] Horace means to say, that Regulus had foreseen
the danger to posterity of a precedent which should sanction the purchase of
life upon dishonorable terius, ‘ This the far-seeing mind of Regulus gum-ded
against, when he refused to-agree to dishonorable conditionS, and drew from
such a recedent a presa of ruin upon generations to come.’

17. gi non periret, etc. ‘ If the prisoners were not left to die unpitied.’

18. Captiva pubes] In the year B. c. 256, during the first Punic war, M.
Atilius Regulus», being consul, invaded Africa, and after many successeS,
taking many towns and laying waste the country, he was terribly defeated
and taken prisoner with 500 others. After he had been five years a prisoner,
the Carthaginians sent him to Rome to negotiata peace,- which, at his own
instigation, was refused. He returned, and according to the general account
was put to death, it is said with torture, but that may be an invention.

22. τεν-90] Dative, for ‘in tergum.' ⁴ ,

23. ‘Persasque non clausas] ‘ the gates (o‘f Carthage) wide open.' The
same image of security appears in A. P. 199 t “ Et apertis otia portis.” No
attempt was made to carry the war into Africa after Regulus’s defeat, though

’ it lasted fourteen years longer. ,

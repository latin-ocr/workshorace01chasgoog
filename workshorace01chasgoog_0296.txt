chapter of Judges, ver. 28 t “ The mother of Sis-era looked out at a window,
and cried through the lanice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? wh
tan-y the wheels of his chariot? '’ There are four objects in respect of whic
Fortune is here said to be involmd, -—· the seasons, the winde, war, and fac·
tion. (See Introduction.) She is said to be an object of reverenee to the
distant and barbamus nations, as well as the cities and rovinoes of the Ro-
man world, and Eastern mother-s and tyrants fearin for t eir crowns.

14. Stantem columnam,] The figures of Peace‚ ecurity, Ha pineas, and
othei-8, are each re sented on old monuments as testing on a co umn. What
Horace means is, t t tyrants are afraid lest Fortune should overthrow their
power, re resented fi rativel by a standing column. ι

15. A arma — a arma] he repetition of these words sugg-ests the cry of
the ‘ throngding people ’ (‘ frequens populus '). ‘ Cessantes ’ means the peaoea·

{¹7 . e semper anteit saeva Necessitas} The several things that Necessity is
here represented as holding, are emblems οἲ tenacity and fixedness of purpose,
— the nan, the clamp, and the molten, lead : they have nothing to do with
torture, as many have supposed. ⁴ Anteit ’ is to be scanned as a diss llable.

18. Clavos bubalos] ese were nmis of the largest sort, for astening
beams in large houseS. There is said to be one in the Museum of the Grand
Duke of Tuseany, at Florenoe, weighing fifty poundS, made of bronze. ‘ Clavi
trabales ' had passed into a proverb with the Romans. Compare Cicero, (in
Verr. Act. ii. 5. 21) : “ ut hoc beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali
clavo figeret.” ‘ Cunei ’ were also nails wedgc-shapcd. On the nails of Fate,
see C. iii. 24. 7, The metaphor of molten lead, used for strengthening build-

μόέΙ. Te Spes et albo] The picture represented in this and the follow'
stanzaS, apart from the allegory, is that of a rich man in adversity, ing fo
from his home, with hope in his breast, and accompanied by a ew faithful
friends», but deserted by those who onl cared for his wealth. In the person
of Fortune, therefore, is re resented t e man who is sufferin from her re-
verses ; and in that of Fidellty, the small (‘ rara ’) company of is true friends·
Fortune is re resented in the garments of moumin ς mutata veste '), and
Fides in a w lite veil, emblematic of her purity. it· 1 such a veil on their
heads, men offered sacrifice to her. She is called by Virgil (Aen. i. 292 ,
‘ Cana Fidesss but there it probably means ‘ aged.' According to Livy (i. 21 ,
Numa established religious rites for Fides.

22. nec comitem abneyat,] ‘ nor refuses herself for thy companion,’ as if ‘ se ’

Horace, who uses it here and in C. iii. 29. 47 : “ neque Diffinget infectumque
reddet.” It means here to break up or unmake, with the purpose of forging
it again. ‘ Ο Ι pray thee on new auvil recast the blunted sword, for the
Scythian and the Arab.’ It h'ad been blunted in civil war, and was to be
whetted again for the destruction of the barbarians.

is got from the notion of rubbing and polishing. Horace applies it to a
woman’s ankles, a smooth-faced boy, the cords of a net, and a saultless man.
It is applied by Ovid (Fast. ii. 320) to a girdle, and by Virgil (Aen. xi. 579)
to the t'hong of a sling3 where, as here, it represents the exact twisting of a
¹ cord. ‘ Plagae ’ were nets os thick rope with which the woods were sur-
roundcd to catch the larger beasts as they were driven out b dogs and
beaters. (Epod. ii. 32. Epp. i. 6. 583 18. 46.) Marsus for arsicus, as
Medus for Medicus, is the only form Horace uses. The country of the
Marsi, east of Rome, Umbria, and Lucania were all famous for boars, being
abundant in acornS, on which they fed and grew fat. Laurentian boars were
also celebrated. See S. ii. 3. 234 3 4. 41. 43.

29. Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium] The ivy, which was sacred to
Bacchus, made a fit and usu‘al gal-land for a lyric poet. “ Doctarnm fron-
tium ’ἰ is the proper description of poete, who by the Greeks were called
σο οι.

ἰῇ). me yelidum nemus] This is an imaginary scene, in which Horace sup-
poses himself wandering in cool groves, sui-rounded with dancing bands of
wood-nymphs (Dryads and Hamadryads) and satyrs, and listening to the
flute of Euterpe, and the l re of Lesbos struck by Polyhymnia. ‘ Tibia'
was a sort of fiageolet. cn it is used in the plural (as here, C. iv. 15. 30,
Epod. ix, 5), it has reference to two of these instrumente played by one per-
son. Their pitch was different, the low-pitched tibia being called ⁴ dextra,'
because it was held in the right hand, and the high-pitched ‘ sinistra,' be-
cause it was held in the left. Euterpe, the Muse‚ was said to have invented
the ‘ tibia,’ and she especially presided over music. Polyhymnia, or Polym-
nia‚ another Muse, invented the lyre.

34. Lesboum—barbiton] The lyre of Sappho and AlcaenS, who were
natives of Mytilene in the island of Lesboe, and flourished at the same
time, about the end of the seventh century Β. 0. (C. ³2. 5.)

35. szd si] Although the personal pronoun ⁴ tu ’ is emphatic in this
sentence, it is omitted, as is often the case in poet , where no opposition of
persons is intended. -- ‘Lyricis ' is less common an ‘meliciS‚' to describe
the lyric oets of Greece.

Lysi-icis} The most celebra-ted of the lyric poets of Greece were Pindar,
Alcaeus, appho, Stesichorus, Ilycu3‚ Bacchylides, Simonides, Alcmeon,

and Anacreon.

ODE 11.

Tms Ode seems to have been written on the return of Augustus to Rome,
after the taking of Alexandria, when the civil wars were brought to a close
and the temple of Janus was shut, n. c. 29. Horace here urges Augustus
to take upon himself the task of reducing to order the elements of the state,
which so many years of civil war had thrown into confusion, and he does
so in the following manner. He refers to the prodigies at Julius Caesar's
death, as evidences of the divine wrath for the guilt of the civil wate. He
then invokes one god after another to come and restore the state, and finally
fixes upon Mercnry, whom he entreats to take upon himself the form of a
man, and not to leave the earth till he has accomplished his mission and
cmxluered the enemies of Rome. The man whose form Mercury is to take
is anastas,

If {iis Ode is mad with c. ii. 15, and the others mentioned in the intro-
duction to that Ode, the feeling with which Horace entered into the mission
of Augustus as the reformet will be better understood!

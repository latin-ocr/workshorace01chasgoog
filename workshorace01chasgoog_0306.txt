onus. -— BOOK 11. 291

13. ferox Aetas Time is compared to awild horse, as in Ovid (Fast. vi.
772): “fugiunt reno non remorante dies.” The words that follow mean,
⁴ she will approach the flower of her age, as you recede from it '3 which is ex-

ressed thus: ‘ the 'years which time takes from your life, he will add to
ers.’ The way of speaking is like that of Deianira, when, comparing ὅθι·
own age and attractions with those of her rival, she says :—
ὁρῶ γὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν ἕρπουσαν προσω,
τὴν δ’ αὖ φθίνουσαν.
ξιὸοορὶιέὴΤιῖἒὶι. v. 547, sqq.) It is also explained by those verses in the Epis-
ω e isoues :—
“ Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Multa recedentes adimunt.”
(v. 175, sq.)

16. Lalaqe] This name is formed from λαλεῖν, “ dulce loquentem '' (C.
i. 22. 24 .

20. Cauliana ques,] This name, which is Lydian, Horace employs again
(C. iii. 7. 5). This boy is represented as a slave from Cnidus in Caria, and
he is said to be so beautiful that, if he were introduced at supper among the
girls, the cleverest of the company could not detect him. ‘ Discrimen obscu-
rum ’ means a difference hard to see.

24. ambiyuoqnoe vultu] Ovid expresses the same ambiguity in the case of
Atalanta very elegantly (Met. viii. 322) :—

“ Talis erat cultus3 facies quam dicere vere
'virgineam in puero puerilem in virgine possis.''
Βογίιῗὴ let their hair grow till they assumed the ‘toga virilis,' about their fifi-
teon year. ·

Or· Septimius, to whom this Ode is addressed, we know nothing, except
that he was au intimate friend of Horace’s, as we gather also from the letter of
introduction he gave him to Tiberius (Epp. i. 9). He had a house at Taren-
tum, where Horace probably paid him one or more visits. Beyoud this we
know nothin of Septimius.

It was pro bl on or after a visit to SeptimiuS, that Horace composed the
Ν... ..emmaum 122‘3221’1 -..U
μζ it is· ⁰3⁰ ἔξω where he viould choose to end'his ‹121st He siys the samo

Auamma-1⁸. — Septimius, 1 would that Ι might end my days at Tibur, or,
if that be forbidden me, at Tarentum. Above all others I love that spot,
with its honey‚ its oliveS, its long spring, and mild winter, and pes on
Mount Aulon. On that spot we ought to live together-5 and ere thou
shouldst lay my bones, and weep over them.

1. Semimi, Gades aditure mecum] That is, ‘who art ready to go with me,
if need be, to the ends of the earth! See above C. 2. 10, ιι.

2. Cantabrum indoctum] At any time before Β. c. 29, when the Cantabri
were first reduced, they could have been called by 'Horace ‘indoctos juga
ferre nostra‚’ even though no attempt had been made to impose that yoke.
In 29 they were reduced to subjection; in 26 they broke out again, and m the
following year they were finally subdued, though an insurrection had to be
put down by Agrippa, some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21 3 iv. 14. 41.

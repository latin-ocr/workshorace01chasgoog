2. Rursus bella moves 9] See Introduction.

3. Non sum quaeis eram] Epp. i. l. 4. He here calls Cinara good be- ‚

cause she is dead ς elsewhere he calls her ‘ rapax ’ Epp. i. 14. 33). It seems
like! that this name represents a real person, w ether she appears under
anot er name elsewhere or not, and that Horace had an affection for her.
In the thirteenth Ode of this book (v. 22) her death is mentioned with feeling,
and there is a reality in the references to her in all the places where she is
alluded to, which cannot be connected with fiction. She was associated, in

all probability with Horace’s early days. Κυνάρα significa, some say, a wikl
ωῗ-Ἢῗαῖῗεν (εῗιὲἔὲσέιῗέιῖἒιἇῑηῗναὲἓίιοῖιῖθῖἱᾞὲζικίᾕ 9. 1. Horace here does not
copy himself, I believe, but some Greek original. ‘Flectere ’ is a metaphor
taken from the breaking in of a horse.

6. lustra] C. ii. 15. 13, n, ‚See Introduction.

9. in domum] ‘ More seasonably shalt thou keep thy revela in the house
of Paullus Maximus, drawn b th beautiful swans.' So Livy (xl. 7), ‘·‘ Quin
comissatum ad fratrem imus!y dere ‘ comissabere ’ is equivalent to ‘ comis·
satum ibis,' and therefore the reading ‘in domum ’ is correct. Κωμὰσδω
ποτὶ τὸν Ἀμαρῦλλιδα is an expression of Theocritus just like this (iii. 1).
Κώμῳ χρὲεσθαι ἐς ἀλλήλους occurs in Herodotus (i. 21). ‘ Purpureis,'
(which signifies beauty without reference to color) savors of the Greek.
‘· Torrere jecur' is like Theocritus's ὀπτεύμενος ἐξ Ἀφροδίτης (vii. 55).

14. sollicitis non tacitas reis] Compare C. ii. 1. 13, where he calls Ponio
“ Insigne moestis raesidium reis.”

15. centum] Τ is is a large definite number for an indefinite.

ΠΙθὲὃΙᾷιΞιεε saynaseret] The idea corresponds to “ militavi non sine gloria ''
m. . . .

( 17. Et)quandoque] i. e. ‘wheneven with thiae aid, his smiles shall beat the
rich presents of his rival, he shall set thee up in marble, under a. eitron roof,
by the shore of the Alban lakes,’ of which there were two close together,
the Albanus (Albano) and Nemorensis (Nemi), and on one of these it

22. Duces thuan] ‘Ducere' is used for drinking, and here for inhaling.
It has a great variety of meanings, which the context will general-ly explain.

28. ter quatient humum] See C. iii. 18. 16. On the first few days of
March, during the festival of Mars, the Salii, his priests, went in processioa

⁴ through the city sing-ing and dancing, whence they are said to have derived

their name. “Jam dederat Saliis (a saltu nomina ducunt) '' (ovid, F. iii.
387). The practice, according to Livy, was instituted by Numa (i. 20), “ per
ιέώοιέι ire canentes carmina cum tripudiis sollennique saltatione jussi sunt.''

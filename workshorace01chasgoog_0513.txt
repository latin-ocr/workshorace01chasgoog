EPISTLES.-BOOK 1.

 

EPISTLE Ι.

Son time aster Horace had published his three books of odes, and had,
as it a arS, laid aside that sort of fflting, it seems that Maecenas, and
probab y his other friends, begged him to return to it. That is the obvious
meaning of the remonstrance with which the Epistle opens· He expresses
an earnest wish to retire into privacy, to abandon poeti-y, and to devote him-
self to the study of philosophy and virtue, which he recommends as the only
true wisdom.

1. Prima dicte mffiiss This is an affectidnate way of speaking. It has no ’

particular reference to anything Horace had written. It is like Virgil's ad-
ss to Pollio (Ec. viii. ll) : “ A te principium, tibi desinet ’² 3 or Nestor’s
to Agamemnon (ΙΙ. ix. 96) τ

2. Spectatum εαίἰε et donatum 'am rude} When gladiatore received their
discharge, they were presented y the ‘ lanista,' or the ‘ editor spectaculo-
rum,’ who owned or hired them, with a ‘ rudiS,’ which was a blunt woodcn
instrument, some say a sword, others a cudgel. The name may have be-
longed to any weapon used in the ‘ praelusio, or sham fight that generally
preceded the real battle with sharp swords. The gladiatore thus discharged
were called ‘rudiarii,’ and, if they were freemen, ‘exauctorati' ‘ Specta-
tum ' is a technical term. Tickets, with the letters SP upon them, were
given to gladiatore who had distinguished themselves. ‘ Ludus ’ means the
place where the training took place, and the gladiatore were kept. (See A.

. 32, n.

4. Vatinius armis Hem-ulis ad postem] Veianius was a ‘ rudiarius,’ and
when he was discharged, he hung up his weapons in the temple of Hercules,
just ss the man is made to han up the arms of love in the temple of Venus,

his chain to the Lares (see S. i. 5. 65, η), to whom also boys dedicated their
‘ bulla ⁹ when they assumed the ‘ toga virilis ' ; and, generali , those who
gave up any trade or calling dedicated the instruments with w ich they had
ollowed it to the gods, and to that god, in particular, under whose patronage
they had laced {gemselvea Hercules would naturally be chosen by a glad-
iator, οι· a so ier.

6. Ne po'pulum extrema] The gladiatorial shows at this time were exhib-
ited in the Circus, The arena was separated from the scats, which went
round the building, b a wall called the ‘ podium,' near which a gladiator
would station himselfy to appeal to the compassion of the people, at whose

to their influence the appeal would be more immediately made. VeianiuS,
Horace sayS, retired into the country to escape the temptation to eng-age
himself again, and to place himself in the position he had so often occupied,
of a suppliant for the people's favor. When they liked a man, they were not
easlilylffirsuaded to ask for his discharge.

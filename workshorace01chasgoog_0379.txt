protulit] ‘ Profene,' meaning to ‘ produce ' (as we say) a work of art, is not
common. Perhaps it does not occur elsewhere. ‘ Ponere ' is a more com·
mon word. See A. P. 34: ‘⁴ Quia ponere totum Nesciet.''

15. fuyue] This is only a way of expressing his hasty departure from
Italy at the summons of the Canhagiuian senate.

16. Rq'edaeque retrorsum] This refers to Hannibal’s final defeat at Zama,
as is shown by the reference to the muse of Ennius (¹ Calabrae Pieride8,' v.
20), which was employed in the praises of the elder Scipio.

17. Non incendia] Carthago was destroyed by Scipio Africanus Minor,

Minor. In S. n. 1. 6⁵ he is mentioned m the same way as the man

From a strict rendering o Horace’s worda, therefore, it would seem as if
Ennius had written the praiseS, not only of the elder, but also of the younger
Scipio, who burnt Carthage twent ’·three years after the death of EnniuS.
But, with a reader acquainted wi the factS, no confusion could arise, and
Horace wrote for those who knew them well.

20. Calabrae Pierides .·] The muse of Calabria, i. e. of EnniuS, who was
born at Rudiae, a Calabrian town, B. c. 239. He wrote, as observed above,
a poem on the elder Scipio.

25. Aeacum] This was a mythical king of AEgina, and much celebrated
for his justice. After his death he was made judge in Elysium (C. ii. 13. 23,
ιι), which, according to the later mythology, was one of the divisions of
TartarnS, but which the earlier notions placed in certain blessed islands in
the Western Ocean, by the Romans identified with the AzoreS. (See Epod.
xvi. Int.) Horace says it was not only his virtue and the public esteem, but
also the poet's praise, that gained AEacns this honor. His praises and those
of his famil are frequent in Pindar. .

ODE IX.

M. Lemnos, to whom this Ode is addressed, as we have seen (C. iv. 2,
Int.), was defeated by the Sigambri, B. c. 27, which disaster caused a great
deal of alarm at Rome, and very probably raised a good many voices against
him, and gave an advantage to his enemies. It is not improbable, therefore,
that Horace wrote this Ode to meet their attackS, and to console Lollius under
his defeat. He declares that his name shall not die, as many noble names
have died, for lack of a poet to sing it. He praises him for his sagacity‚ up-
rightness, frcedom from avarice, and hatrcd of corruption.

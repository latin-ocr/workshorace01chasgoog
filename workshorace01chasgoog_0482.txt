Lares who have protected him from those vices!

168. Servius Oppidius] This person is unknown, except from this passage. ι
He lived at Canusium, a town of Apulia (see S. i. 5. 91, 11.). Horace sa
he was rich even with two farms, according to the standard of incomes in t
old times. As to the form ‘divisse,' see S. l. 5. 79. This story serves to
connect the subject of avarice with that of ambition, which is the next form
of madness and profligacy which follows.

171. talos, -nucesqueJ The ‘ talus ' was the knuckle-bone of some animal,
generally a. sheep, the Greek name for which was ἀστράγαλος. The manner
of pla ing with {t was the same among the Greeks and the Romans, and the
same {ones are still used by boys in En land. The ancients used them in

ii. 7Ῐ 17, 11.) Boys hadV also games of various kind's wilth nuts', as they have
now. Suetonius relates that Augustus used to amuse himself by laying
with little boys at these gameS. Oppidius observed that his son Au us car-
ried about his bones and his nuts in a careless way in a loose fold of his toga,
ready to give them away to any of his companions, or 1ο lose them at play3
while Tiberius always counted his carefully and hid them away, carrying a
serious face wherever he went; and from these carly signs of character he
foresaw that one would prove a spendthrift‚ and the other a miser. As to
NomentanuS, see S. i. l. 102, 11.; and on Cicuta, see above, v. 69.

178. ουσιαι] Kee s within bounds, defines, limita.

181. is intestabilis et sacer esea] A person who was ‘ intestabilis,’ as the
word implieS, could not appear as a witness before a magistrate, and so lost
virtually much of his capacity for rivate rights. ‘ Sacer ’ was 0110 condemned
for some great crime, who might Ee put to death by anybody‚ without cha
of murder. Thus Oppidius ·imprecates a curse upon his sons, if they shou d
ever aspire so high as to the office of an aedile or a praetor.

182. In cicere atque aba] As if his sons were alread secking voteS, he
says to each of them for ‘ tu ' must be so understood), ‘ 0 you would throw
away your money in distributing· largesses to the people (such as the aediles
were wont 1ο give), in order that you may strut about 111 1110 Circus, and
have a bronze statue voted you,— that is 10 say, that you may be loaded
with the same honors as the great Agrippa, like a. fex aping a lion! It was
customary for the aediles to distribute grain, or vegetables of the sort men·

( 183. ’Latus —s tiere] This is explained in the note 011 Epod. iv. 7. As
to ‘aeneuS,’ see . iii. 3. 65, 11. The form of expression ‘ aeneus ut stes ' is
lvike tha: 1111 C. iv, 1. 19 ε “Albanos prope te lacus Ponet marmoream ”3 and

1 . c . vii. 35 : ‘

The same way of speaking is common in Greek. Such statues as are here

SATIRE 111.

Tms Satire appears to have been written during the Saturnalia, in the
mouth of December, Β. c. 32. The year before, Agn‘ppa had been AEdile,
and his aedileship is alluded to in v. 185. It was written at Horace's coun-
try-house, not long, it may be supposed, after it was given him. He was
improvin the house at the time, as we ma infer from v. 308. The Satire
is genera , taking in the leading vices and ollies of human nature,—ambi.-
tion, avarice, extravagance, lust, superstition, which are brought together with
some i nuit .

One amasjlppns, a man who had wasted a good fortune in speculating as
an amaoeur in all sorts of costly articles, particularly works of art, in which
he was held to be a eonnoisseur‚ is introduced in a new character, as a Stoic
philosopher, reproving Horace for his laziness, and nrging him to write. He
relates the story of his own conversion to philosophy, which was this. When
he had lost all his fortune, and was hopelessly involved with money-leaders,
and found himself laughed at and called madman wherever he went, he grew
desperate, and was going to throw himself into the Tiber, when he was ar-
rested b Stertinius, an oracla of the StoicS, who remonstrated with him and
consoles him, and at the same time armed him against his enemies (v. 297)
with a long homily, in the course of which he proved that all the world, but
the and wisc, were as mad as he was. In this discourse he enumerates
the ‘ef features of this universal madness, and this forms the bulk of the
Satire.

Of Damasippus ve little is known. But he was a real person, though
perhaps a little before oraee's day. Why Horace should have chosen this
man as the mouth-pieee of his Satira does not appear. Damasippus sa ἐ
himself, it is true, that, having ruined his own affairs, he had nothing to o
but to attend to the affairs of others3 which Horace interprete to mean, that
he had taken to giving advice when it was not asked (see v. 27, n.).

Stertinius appears to have been an authority among the Stoics of the day.
The Scholiasts tellus he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school.
Damasi pus calls him (v. 296) “ sapientum octavus.'' His books, if he ever
wrote em, have not rescued him from oblivion. Horace mentions him
again, in Epp. i. 12. 20, as the repiesentative of the sect.

The discourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that every man in the
world, high or low, is mad, except the sage (see note on v. 46). Cicero has

argued the same doctrine of the Stoics in his Paradoxa (iii. ὅτι πᾶς· ἄφρων
paiz-craz), but he does not go very deep into the subject, or throw much light

upon it.

2. Mernzmnam poscas,] Horace speaks of parchment (‘ membrana ') only
twice (A. P. 389), ‘charta‚' which means the Egyptian papyrus, being his
usual equivalent for a book. From the thin coats of the papyrus the name
‘ liber' was derived, and parchment was less generally used in Horaoe’s da
than the apyrus ; though that material was also commonly employeg
‘ Texere c artam ’ is a common expression for putting the pieces of ‘the
papyrus together. ‘ Retexere scripta‚' therefore, means to take· to pieces or
tear up what is written, or to take out leaves aud substitute others, with dif-

ferent writings upon them· ,ᾖ . --

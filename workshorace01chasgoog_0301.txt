‘ cruoribus ' is unusual, and savors of the Greek. So Aesch. Supp. 265:

6. Perimam plenum ο aleae,] ‘A task full of hazard,' literally, ‘full
of perilous ehanee.' Po ‘o hadbeen faithful to Julius Caesar, but aster his
death had sided rather with M. Antonius than Augustus3 and therefore,
when the latter had succeeded in putting an end to his rival, and bad the
entire power in his own hands, it was a bold and difficult task that Pollio
had undertaken. It does not appear, however, that he involved himself in

bulguzznooegubi ρῖιὸίίοαε Ra ordinaris] ‘ When you shall have finished your

history of public events? The Greeks used συντάσσειν for writing a book.

Plutarch uses σῦνταγμα for a book. ἈΜ-τάξασθαι occurs in the preface to
St. Luke’s Gospel, and is thus rendered in the vulg-ate translation, “ Quo-
niam quidem multi eonati sunt ordinare narrationem.’' It seems that Pollio
was writing tragedy at the same time with his history, and the style of the
one ma have affected the style of the other: so that Horace advises him to
lay asi e his tragedies, in order that he may do justice to his histo . As the
theme is delicate, and he is well able to adorn it, he should ut asiliy the only
obstacle to its proper accomplishment‚ viz. his ‘es hey were proba·

exce t wit Horace and Virgil, who were under personal obligations to him.

11. yrande munus] ‘lllgbou shalt put on the Attio cothurnus, and return tc
thy lofty task! The ‘ cothurnus ' was a shoe worn b trag-ic actorS, the use
and name of which were borrowed by the Romans rom the Athenians. It
was usually ornamented with purple, and strapped up the leg nearly to the
knee. When worn on the stage, it bad a thick sole and a high heel, to add to
the actor's height. Men of rank wore the ‘ cothurnus.' Horace speaks figu-
rativel , when he says that Pollio shall ut on the ‘ cothurnus,' meaning that
he s l return to writing tragedies (seellast note).

23. cuncta ten-arum subacta] It is probable that Pollio had given a stirring
account of Caesar's African campaign, in which he himself served, and that
his description had made a great impression upon Horace. The victory of
ThapsuS‚ B. c. 46, made Caesar master of the whole Roman world. ‘ Cuncta

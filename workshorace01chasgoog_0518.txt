EPISTLES. — Boon 1. - ’ '503

92. conducto naviyio] ‘ Navigium ' expresses the vulgar crast which the
poor man hires in imitation of the private yacht, as smartly built and well
found as a trireme belonging to the rich man. He hires his boat, which he
cannot afford'to de, and goes through the horrors of sea-siekness‚ that he may
have the honor of serving as a soil to the elegance of his wealthy neighbor.

94. Si sumtus inaequali tonsore] He goes on to tax Maecenas, good-hu·
moredly, with the prevailing inconsistency (94 - 105). ‘ Capillos curare ’ was
a common expression. Domitian wrote a book ‘ de cura ca illorum‚' accord·
{Ing tolfSue‘tgnlgs (1318), which hedagldressed to a {lriemtlhw 9 twas bald, llilcrle

was the upper tunic. ‘Pexae’ significa a eloth of which the na was not
closely shorn, and was still fresh. The upper tunic, therefore, wo d be new,
while the under one was old and shabby. The ‘ subucula' had sleeves,
which the ‘ intusium ' had not. An difference in the cloth, therefore, would
be very perceptible. Out of doors t e toga would conceal both, but in doors
the toga was not worn. ‘ Intusium’ is from ‘indum’ ‘ Subucula’ is con-
nected with ‘duo' (that is, ‘do’) likewise. ‘Disconvenit' is a word only
found in Horace. It occurs again, Epp. 14. 18.

100. mutat quadrata rotundis i’] Orelli says this looks like a proverbial
ἓκρτθεεὲἓιι for one {who did noHt know his omi-mind. ΚΠ may δερ-ο, (ἐξ it may

cenas would understan . e appears to have begun building as soon as he
entered on his new property, if there is any meaning in the scolding he gets
from Damasippus (S. ii. 3. 307).

102. nee curatoris egere] See S. ii. 3. 217, n. ‘ Tutela ' was the guardian-
ship of a ‘ tutor,' the retector of an orphan’s property till he came to the age
of puberty. ‘ Curate ' was the office of ‘ curator‚' who hnd the same rela-
tion to the orphan, in a modified form, till he was twenty-five (see above, v.
22, n). It was also that of the rotector of insane persons. ⁶ Tutela,’ there-
fore, 1s not the recise word to ecp up the previous notion. Horace means
that Maecenas ooks after him anxiously‚ as if he was his ‘tutor,' and·he
looks up to him as if he was his ‘ pupilluS,’ bnt that his guardian had better
look to his greater faults, and correct those, than be put out by trifling de-
fects, such as negligence of dress, and so forth. What Horace says, is a ne ·
etition in a different form of “ Ο et praesidium et dulce decus meum '’ ( .
i. 1. 2 . ·

10δέ respicientis] This word is much sti-unger than our term ‘respect,'

:which is derived from it.

106. Ad summam .·] This is an ordinary formula, ‘ to come to the point,'
‘to conclude! The pursuit of virtue and wisdom is the point from which he
started, and, having digressed a little, he returns suddenly, and concludes
with a definition of the sege, which is a repetition of S. i. 3. 124, sqq. Here
it is added that he is the only theeman, and inferior to Jove alone.

108. Praece‘pue sanus] Horace says jocularl , that the Stoic above all his
other attributes is of course ‘ sanus, except w en his digestion is disturbed
and the phlegm troublesome; ⁶ sanus ' bearing a. double application to the
body (from the pains of which no exem tion was claimed for the Stoic sage,
though he did not allow them to affect is will) and to the mind, the samt
of which no one could lay claim to but the sage himself (see S. ii. 8. 44, ng
As to ‘ pituita,' see S. ii. 2. 73, n.

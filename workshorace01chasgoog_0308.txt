1. tempas in ulamau] During the two years between his leaving home
and the battle of Philippi, Brutus went through many hard-fought battles
with the native tribes iu Macedonia and in Asia Minor, as well as iu resist-
ing the assumption of his province by C. Antonine, the triumvir's brother,
to whom the Senate had assigned it. ‘ Tempus in ultimum' does not mean
so fflh to the brink os the grave, as we should say, as into extreme danger

3. redoeum't Quiritem] This word ‘redonare' is peculim-to Horace. He
uses itagain, C. iii. 3. 33. ‘Quiritem' has particular force as ‘unshorn of
your citizenship.’ He had not beeu ¹ capite deminutus! See Aesch. Eum.
757, Ἁργεῖος ἀνὴρ αὖθις. The singular ‘ Quiris ' is not found iu prose-
vriters. It occurs again in Epp. i. 6. 7.

5. prime sodcdium,] ‘ Prime ' means ‘earliest and best! It is probable
that the days Horace enjoycd so much with his friend were spent at Athens,
when they were both young students. The language does not seem to suit a

9. Philippos et celeremfuyam] ‘the rout at Philippi! We need not take
Horace too much at his word. He was not born for a soldier, any more than
his friend Iccius (C. i. 29); and he could afford to create a laugh against
himself as a ῥίψασπις, a cowasd who runs away and leaves his shield behind
him. He had in mind, no doubt, the misfortune that befell Alcaeus, as related
by Herodotus (v. 95). See C. i. 32. 5, n. There was nothing disgraceful iu
the ssight from Philippi, which Brutus advised and necessity compelled.

AEneas’s by Phoebus in a thick cloud (Il. v. 344. en. x. 81).

17. obliyatam] The sacrifice (and feast that followed) which he had vowed,
or ought to have vowed if he had not, to Jove. ,

18. Laremque—militia] Pom eius had probably had no rest for more thau
thirteen ears, beginning with t e wars of Brutus, A. mc· 710, and ending
with the ttle of Actium.

22. Cibaria] A drinking-cup like the pod of an Egyptian bean, of which
this was the name. ‘ Funde ' means ⁴ pour upon your head! ‘ Udo ' is like

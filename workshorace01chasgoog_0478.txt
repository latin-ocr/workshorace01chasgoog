story, Pacuvius founded a tragedy called Ilione, and in one of the soenes the
ghost of Dei hilus is introduced in his mother’s bed—chamber, calling upon
her to give is body burial in these words (preserved in Cic. Tusc. Disp. i.
) “ Mater, te adpello quae curam somno suspensam levas,
Neque te mei miseret ; surge et sepeli natum.”

to the vanished ghost, like Hamlet, —- “ Age, adsta, mane, audi, iteradum
eademmet ista mihi’' (Cic. Acad. Prior. ii. 27). Cicero made a proverb of
these words, ‘Manen te appello‚' using them in various illustratione. See his
speech Pro Sestio, c. 59.

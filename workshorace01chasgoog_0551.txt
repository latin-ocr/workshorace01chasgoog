Cicero did not eppmve of it. He says, “ vetat egeras injussu imperato·
ris, id est Dei, de praesidio et statione vitae ccedere’' (Cat. Maj. c. 20).
The ancieuts had very loose notions on suicide. ’

79. mors ultima linea rerum est] This refers to the ‘ alba linea ' mentioned
on Epp. 14. 9, which was the goal as well as starting-point in the chariet-
races-

 

EPISTLE XVII.

Wno Scaeva was there are no means of ‹ieter-mining, und it is quite im-
material. He bears no art in the Epistle‚ which might have been addressed
to anybody of his age. ts professed purpose is to instruct a youn man how
to rise in the world by payinffi com-t to great o le, which is dec ed to be
an art of no small ment. T e chief secret o thls art is said to be a well-
affected modesty, and a tect in letting your wants be rather felt than heard by

your patron, and this is the only advice that is offered. The Epistle ends
abruptly, and is a mere fragment. “

3. 'docendus aestua] He was young, and hed yet much to leam. ‘Amicu-
lus ' is a diminutive expressing endem-ment.

4. Caecus iter monstrare velit ,·] Erasmus quotes as a proverb μήτε τυφλὸν

ὁδηγὸν, μήτε ‘'xvcim-ov σύμβουλον. Our Lord twice used it in instructing
his disciples (Matt. xv. 14, Luke vi. 39).

8. Ferentinum] This was a municipium on the Via Latina, about fort-y-
six miles from Rome, in the country of the Hernici. It still retains its name
Ferentino. It appears not to have been much frequented, and Horace recom-
mends his friend to go there, if the object of his wishes is to avoid the noise

ofethgassown, and to lead a quiet life, which he says is not without its recom-
m n xons.

10. moriensque fisellit.] Horace uses ‘fallere ’ as the Greeks used λανθάνειν
(see C. iii. 16. 32, n.). But it is only used absolutely here and in the next
Epistlc (v. 103). Horace takes his expression from the Greek proverb
{3⁶⁶⁶ Riobe-as, which appears to have been used by the Epicureans and

renmcS.

y11. Si prodesse tuis] Horace’s argument for servility is, that it is neees-
zny'bilf a man wenis to be of use to his friends, and to make himself eom-
στω. e.

12. siccus ad unctum] As a poor man to the rich. ‘ Siccus ' means poor,
ns one who cannot command a dinner‚ or can only command a dry one;
und ‘ unctus ’ means a. rich man who fines sum tuously. The Cynics were
called ξηρόφσγοι from their abstinentie, and ηροφαγία among the early
Christians was a fast.

13. Si pranderet olus patienter] There is a story of Aristippus, that he was
one day passing Diogenes, the Cynic, while he was washing some vegetnbles
for his dinner, and he was accosted thus : “If you had learnt to put up with
this, you would not have been a slave in the palece of kings,'’ alluding to
his having been the guest of Dionysius of Syracuse. The answer of ris·
tippus was: “And if you knew how to associate with your sellom, you
would not now be washing herbsss’ ·

where Antisthenes taught, the Cynosarges, a gymnasium at Athens. The
popular notion of a Cynic (expressed by ‘ mordacem‚’ ‘biting ’) is derived
rather from the conduct of the followers (of whom Diogenes was one) than
of the founder of the school.

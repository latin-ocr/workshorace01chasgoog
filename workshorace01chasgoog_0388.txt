An that rs here said of the sub ection of the world and the universal peace
was said in effect at the close o the fourteenth Ode ; but iuvas natural that

of successes by which universal peace was established.

Anctmnnr. — When Ι would sing of warS, Phoebus checked me with his
lyre. Thy reign, Ο Caesar, hath brought back our lost honor, with plenty
and peace and order, and the means by which our name and strength have* ,
become great. Under thy protection we sear no warS, at home or abroad;
the North and the East obe th laws‚ and we with our wives and children
will sing of the heroes of o ‚ of ‚ and Anchises, and os Venus's son.

Movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae?

Increpuit lyra ' therefone signifies ‘ cheeked me by touehing the stringe o! ‘
his lyre, and leading me to a sti-ain more fitted to my muse! The mlier met·
&hag-his commen enough. See virgil, (Geor-g. ii. 4122 ‘⁴ Pelagoque volana

4.. Τωιιῗ caesar, aetas] The abruptness with which this is introduced is
worth remarking. A longer prcfme would have weakened the Ode. ·

5. fflyes et amris} This is a repetition of C. iv. 5. 17, sq.

6. nostro— Jove] To the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.

7. Dercpta] As the standan-ds were quietly and voluntarily sent to Augus-
tus b Α Phraates, Horaee’s langua e is somewhat exaggerated. The recovery
(see . iii. 5, Introd.) of the stan ards lost by Crassus was one of the greatest
causes of re‘aicing that ever happened at Rome. Without it, the restoration
effected by ugustuS, and of which Horace here gives a coi ‚endious picture,
would have been wanting in one of its chief features; the onor, as well as
the peace, of Rome was restored. These praises are repeated from or in (for
we cannot say which was written first) Epp. ii. 1. 251, sqq. See also Epp. i.

9. Janum Quirini] If’Janum Quirim ’ and not ‘Janum Quirinum ' be
the true reading, Horace assigns to Romulus the building of the temple of
Janus, which is usually assigned to Numa. The other would mean ‘ Janus
called Quirinus,’ a name given him as Janus of the Quirites. As to the shut·
ting of the tem le, see Epp. ii. 1. 255, n.

10. equanti This nowhere else appears with an accusative case, but
‘ evadere ' and ‘ exire ⁸ are used with an accusative repeatedly. (Com C.
iii. 24. 29.) ‘Artes' means those virtues in which the discipline o life is
placed, as prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.

17. furor Civilis aut vis] ‘Civilis’ belongs to ‘furorss and ‘vis‚' which is
a technieal word, means here ‘ personal violence? ⁸ Ira' applies to foreign
quarrels. See C. iii. 14. 14, n.

20. inimicat] This is another word which Horace probably found in use
by writers of a former day. Later writers have taken it from him. It means
‘ sets at enmity.' ‘ Apprecati’ (v. 28), ‘ remixto ' (v. 30), are also words first
found in Horace. ·

21. qui profundum Danubium bibunt] The German tribeS‚ particularly the
Vindelici lately subdued. ‘ Edicta Julia’ can only mean here the laws of
Augustus, laid upon them at their conquest, though in its technical sense the
word ‘edicta' would not apply. The rules of a governor published in his
province were his ‘edietumss and these people were not in a province. Hor-

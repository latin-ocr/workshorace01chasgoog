23. Praeneste seu Ίῖὂαν] See Epp. i. 2. 2, ιι., as to ‘ Praeneste,' and C. ii.
5. 5, n., as to ‘ Tibur,' which rose from the plain on the right bank of the
Anio, on the side of a hill, from which it is called ‘ supinum.'

25. Vestris —fontibusJ All retired streams and shad groves were held
sacred to the Muses (V. 6). Parnassus had its fountain, astalia3 and Heli-
con two, Hippocrene and Aganippe.

26. Phili pis] See C. ii. 7. 9. -

28. Nec §inula Palinurus unda] Horace’s escape from shipwreck off Cape
Palinurus is nowhere else related; and it is doubtful when it happened.
‘ Sicula unda ’ for the Tuscan Sea is an unusual limitation. It must not be
confounded with Mare Siculum, which was on the other side of Sicily.
§agnprus was on the western coast of Lucania. It retains its name as Capo ·

32. Lictoris Assyrii] The Syrian coast. See note on C. ii. 11. 16.

33. Visam Britannos] The stories of the human sacrifices of the ancient
Britons are too authentic to be doubted. See Tacitus (Ann. xiv, 30). Virgil
(Georg. iii. 463) relates of the Geloni (C. i. 19. 10), that they used to eat
cheese dipped in horse's blood. Whether the Concani, who were a Can-
txabrialn tribe, did the same, is doubtful. Horace, perhapS, got his idea fmm

38. addidit] In the year Β. e. 25, after the conquest of the Salassi, a
pcopleof the Gauiish Alps, Augustus assigned their territory to some of the

they built Augusta Emerita (Merida). ‘ Additis ' is used in a like case by
‘'israeitus (Ann. xiii. 31) : “ Coloniae Capua atque Nuceria additis veteranis

matae sunt.”

40. Pierio recreatis antro] SuetoniuS, in his Life of Augustus (84, 85),
relates that he followed literary pursuits with great zeal, and dabbled in
poetry. He could not have had much time for such pur-suits when this Ode
was written, but he may have said enough to let it be seen that he desired
leisure to follow them. As to ‘ Pierio‚’ see A. P. 405.

41. Vos lene consilium] The penultimate vowel coalesces with the next,
as in ‘principium ' (iii. 6. 6), ‘ Alscnius’ (S. i. 3. 130), ‘Nasidieni ' (S. ii. 8.
1). So Virgil says (Aen. i. 73): “Connubio jungam stabili.” ‘Ye give
peaceful counsel, and rejoice in giving it, because ye are gentle <‘ almae ³),’ is
the meaning of the wordS‚ which are to be taken generally.

43. Ἰ itarius immanemque turmam] The wars of the Titanes (with Uranus)‚
the Gigantes, the Aloidae, Typhon, or Typhoeus (with Zeus), are all mixed
u together in the description which follows Virgil has given a description
(georg. i. 279, sqq.) where the Titans (Coeus and Iapetus), Typhon, and
the Aloidae are brought together with little distinction. But neither Horace
nor Virgil was writing a mythological history, aud in this description of
Horace there is great power. ’

44. caduco] ‘ swift-descending,’ as καταιβάτης in AEschyluS.

45. terram inertem] Elsewhere we have ⁴ bruta tellus ' in the same sense,
‘ the dull, motionless earth ’ (C. i. 34. 9).

46. reqna tn‘stia] ‘ the gloomy realms ’- (of Pluto).

50. Fidens juventus hon-ida] This appears to be an imitation of Homer’s
χείρεσσι πεποιθότες (Il. xii. 135). ⁴ Horrida juventus ' means the Gigan-
tes, a family different from the TitaneS, and ounger.

51. fratresque tendentes] The brothers orace speaks of were Otus
Ephialtes, the sons of AloeuS, whose exploit of piling Pelion on Ossa m
their attaek upon Olympus (OlympuS, Ossa, and Pelion formed a con·
tinuous range, running down the coast of Thessaly), is first mentioned by

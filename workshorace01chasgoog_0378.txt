omis—Boon 1v. 363

15. pius Aeneas] Horace's purpose is to show that uo means are sufficient
to bring back the dead, not piety, nor wealth, nor power. There is a similar
vell? Ἓηξῗοῑὲρριᾶαἶ ‹21de annm] ‘ Whate'er thou givest thine own dem·

soul.' This seems to be a literal version of φίλῃ ψυχῇ χαρίζεσθαι.

21. splendida] ‘ J udgment august hath passed! ‘ Splendida' is an unusual
word for such a meaning. As to Μίιιοε, see C. ii. 13. 23, n.

26. Liberat Hippolytmn,] This is in accordance with the legends of Greece
respecting Artemis and Hippolytus She was unable to bring him to life.
The Latin poets make Hippolytus return from the dead, being brought to
life by the skill of AEsculapius; and Diana, in Ovid's account, takes him
and gives him into the care of Egeria, in the woods of Aricia (Met. xv. 543,
sqq.). See also Vir . Aen. vii. 765, sqq.

27. Nec Lethaea ι et] The common story of Theseus and his friend is,
that, both having been consigned to their punishment together, Hercules
went down and delivered Theseus, leaving Peirithous to his fate. This may
be the legend Horace follows: for it may be understood that Theseus pleadcd
for Peirithous when he was himself retaining, but failed to obtain his release.

 

ODE VIII.

C. Mancms Cnusonnvtm, the person to whom this Ode is addressed,
was a man of birth and education, a favorite with Augustae, and generally
much beloved, according to Velleius, who says of his death (in A. D. 2),
“ Graviter tulit civitas.'' Horace pays him the compliment of believing that
he would esteem an Ode of his more highly than any costly gifts he could
offer, in accordance with the common practice among friends of making each
other presents (‘ strenas ') on new-year’s day and other festivals. Censorinus
was consul the year that Horace died.

Anconem. -If 1 were rich in statues and pictur-es, 1 would give such to
my friendS, and the best to thee, Censorinus. But Ι have none, and thou de-
sirest not these. What I have Ι offer, -verscs in which thou delightest.
No monuments of marble, not their own mighty deeds, could ennoble tho
Scipiones like the verses of Ennius. Thine own virtues must remain obscure
but for the Muse. What would AEacus or Romulus have been without hei-‘3
She raises men to the skies, as did Hercules, the Tyndaridae, and Liber.

3. tripodas,] In the temple of Apollo, at Delphi, was a bronze altar on
three legs, called from its form τρίπους. Imitations of this tripod were pre-
sented to the victors at the Pythian games. Herodotus mentions their being
given at the gamos of Apollo at Triopium in Cnidus (i. 144).

is the reputed author of some works that exist to this day3 particularly the

note on S. 1. 7. 8. . Porcius Cato Censorius was born about B. e. 234,

and was therefore contemporary with Ennius, with whom he is associated,
A. P. 56, as successfull importing new words into the language. Fragments·
remain of 1113 treatise Re Rustica, embracing a variety of instructions on
husbandry and subject-s connected with domestic „economy3 and of his Ori-

‘ es, an account of the early history of Italy. There am also frag-ments ol

is orations, which Cicero appears to have studied (Brutus, c. 1⁷). He had
the highest opinion of Cato, and complains that he was not studied enough
even iu his day. M. Cornelius Cethegus was older than Cato, since he was
curule aedile when Cato was no more than twenty. His eloquence was such
that Ennius called Cethegus “ Suadae medulla, orator suaviloquenti ore.”
(Cic. Brut. c. 155 Cat. Maj. c. 14; see Epp. i. 6. 36, 11.) But it does not
appear that any of his orations were extant in Cicero's time, for he only
mentions them on the authority of Ennius, who had heard him speak. His

123. virtute carmtia tollet,] ‘ He will remove what lacks merit? He will
work hard to produce a result which shall appear playful and easy, the turns
being as eas as those of the ‘ mimus,' who dances either the light measure
of the nimb e Satyr, or the clumsy dance of the Cyclops (611 which see S. 1.
5. 63, 11.). The poet’s art is to conceal 1113 art, aud to make that appear
easy which has eost him a good deal of trouble. ⁴ ‚ ‚

126. Praetulerim scriptor] This is supposed to be the remark os one who
would be a poet without the necessary trouble. He would rather be pleased
with his own bad verses, even though he might be deceiving himself, thau be
so learned aud- be perpetually vexed with himself. ‘ Ringere' is properly
applied to the grinning of a dog when it narls. , ·

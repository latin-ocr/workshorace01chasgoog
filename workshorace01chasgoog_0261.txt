“ Roma parentem, —
Roma patrem patriae Ciceronem libera dixitss’

where ‘ libera ⁹ seems to mean that the senate were no longer free agente
when Augustus took the name. See C. iii. 24. 27, n.

prmoewd Tac. Anu. i. 1 τ “ Cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa principis sub
imperium aceepit.” In the Senate there was always one person who was
called ‘ princeps senatusl choseu at theu· own discretiori by the censor-s. It
was nominally as such that Augustus took the title of ‘ princeps ’ rather than
‘ rex‚' which was odious to the Romans. He and his successore are more
osten st led c‘ princeps: ‘than {imperator ' hythe-historiam. ‘'I-'he latter title,

52. Te duce, Caesar-‚l The name of Caesar is introduced abruptly where
that of Mercury might be expected. This abruptneas metenses the effect.

Tms Ode is addreesed to the ship that was carrying Vir-gil the poet on
some occasion to Greece. His constitution was weak, and he probably made
several voyages for the sake of his health. He went, and only returned to
die in n. c. 19, but this ode was written before then. It is taken up with re-
proaches ‘against him who first invented navigation, and a lanient for the

“ presumptiou o( mankind.

Anouunrrr. — We commit to thee virgil, Ο thou ship! deliver him ease
on the shores of Attica, and preserve him whom Ι love as my life; and may
the skies and winds prosper thee. Hard and rash was the man who first
tempted the sea and defled the winda. In what ehape should he leur the

lande, if man is to leap over the forbidden waters. So doth he ever rush into
sin. Prometheus brought flre into the world, and with that theft came all
manner of disee-ses ; Daedalus soared on wingS, and Hercules burst into hell.
Deterred by nothing, we would climb heaven itself ς and our guilt suffers
not Jove to lay aside his bolts.

1. Sic] ‘ Sic ⁹ in this place amouuts to no more than ⁸ utinam ’ in a
strong form, as ὡς does in Greek. There are other passages where ‘' sic '
follows the prayer ‘onN *evhiglhc {t πιέθῗίεηῗὲ as Cat}- 28. ἑξῆς d

where the condition and its cons uence are clearly marked, and an o osite
wish is implied if the condition not fulfilled. But such is not t e case
here; first Horace says, ‘ May the stare and winds prosper thee,' and then
goes on, ‘ O ship, deliver thy trust in safcty!

‘ Poten8,' like its kindred word πότνια, is used with a genitive after it.
Venus (a Latin divinity) is confounded by the poets with the Greek Aphro·
dite, who, from her su posed origin, was imagined to have power over the
sea ; hence Horace ca ls her ‘marina’ (C. iii. 26. 5; iv. ll. 15). She had
the titles εὐπλοία, λιμένιας, had temples built for her in harbors, and is rep·
resented on coins with a rudder, simil, and dolphin. Her principal temples
. were at Idalium and Paphos in C pru3‚ in the island of Cythera off the Pel·
oponnesuS‚ Eryx (C. 2. 33) und' nidus in Caria.

9. Et Moschi causam. .·] If we cati trust the Scholiasts‚ Moschus was a
famous rhetorician of Pergamum, who was charged with the crime of poison-

uses ‘assidet’ to signify resemblance. It is not so used elsewhere. The
guests not uncommonly wore wreaths of flowcrs on their heads, and cairied
them in their hands ; and we can understand their scattering them about the
table and floor, especially when they were men-y. But it appears that the
slaves scattered flowers about, for the sake of their pei-sume. Horace says:
“ Pascentes ego dexteras odi: sparge rosas ’³ (C. iii. 19. 21.). Fresh flowers·
were probably scattered at intervals during the dinner.

11< the year Β. c. 53, Μ. Licinius Crassus, as consul, with the province of
S. 'a, marched an army into Mesopotamia against the Parthians. He sus·
uliae a disast'rous defeat at the hands of Surenas, the Parthian general, and
lost his own life, with 20,000 mcn killed and 10,000 prisonem, besides several
eagle's. Again, in the year n. o. 36, Μ. Antonius attacked- the Parthians, and
was obliged to retreat with great loss.

- There woul'd seem to have been generally prevalent at Rome a feeling of
soreness and impatience under the disgrace, so long unredeemed, of these ·
τεγετεθες arid this feeling it appears to be Horace's purpose in this Ode to
allay, and to discourage any hope or desire for the return of the Parthian
prisoners. This desire Horace seems to impute ‘a degenerata spirit, and
the story of Regulus is introduced apparently to u back men’s minds to the·
feeling'of a former generation.

The standards and many of the prisoners ere restored 'by Phraates, Β. c.
20, a's an aet of conciliation towards Augus us, and their ⁵recovery was pro-
claimed'as a triumph, and recorded upon coins with the inscription “ Signis
receptis.'’ This fiction is repeated in C. iv. 15. 6. Epp. i. 12. 273 18. 56.

Amanum-Jove· is in heaven; Augustus shall be a god upon earth
when he bath subuued the Briton 'and the Persian. What! can a Roman
forget his glorious home and· live a slave· with the Mede ’Ξ ’T was not thus
Regulus acted, when he saw the· ruin a eoward’s example would bring on
those who should eome aster him·; and he erled, “ ‘I have seen our standard's
hung on Punic wall83 our freemen bound ς their gates unbarred3 their fields
all till‘ed. Ye do but add ruln to shame: but virtue, like the former fair
color of dyed wool, can ’never be restored. When the freed hind fights its
captor, the prisoner relcased shall copo ain with his foe, he who has cried
fdr mercy and made peaee for himself on t e battle-field.'’ Thcu, thou h he
knew the crue-l fate which* was in store for him, he parted from his wi e, his
children, and his friends, and went away as calmly as a man would go to
‘Venafrum or Tarentum, to enjoy reposo after concluding his labora in the
city.

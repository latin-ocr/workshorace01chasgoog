23. antiquae plebis] ‘ Plebs ' has not its distinctiva meaning in this place.
(See C. iii. 14. 1, n.) Horace is no doubt touching his own infirmity here.
Re was fond of praising the simplicity of the olden time, but he was not the
man to extricato himself from the degenerate habits of his own day (‘ nequie-
quam coeno cupiens evellere plantam,' which is taken from the Greek proverb

εκτὸς πηλοῦ πόδα ἔχειν). He had been but lately, perhaps, writing the
{hen tigre? {⁸22¹ss ιξούιῗὲἒῖεεὲἕιῗιὲξηΐῖἷιοῗξὴῗᾛᾱ(ἷῖῑὲἓὲᾱιαιῗιιοὸἐῒςῖἶέὶ 2¹2³fo
eleganees of the city. whatever his ordinary fare may have been, he had
no objection to the tables of the rich, and was rond to be invited to the Es-
quiliae. There is much humor in this part of ιξο Satire. He is supposed to
be congratulating himself upon being suffered to dine quietly at home, when
he gets an unexpected invitation from Maecenas to a late dinner. He imme-
diately shouts for his lantern, scolds the servants if they keep him waiting a
moment, and runs off as fast as he can, leaving in the lurch some persons to
‚whonzhe had promised a dinner‚ and who go away disappointed' and mutter-
a use.
mg33. sub lumina prima] ‘ Immediately after the lighting of · the lamps.’
(See Epod. ii. 44, n.) The ordinary dinner-hour was earlier (see C. i. 1. 20,
n.)‚ but Maecenas’s occupations proti-acted his ‘solidus dies‚' at the end of
which he was glad enough, no doubt, to get a cheerful companion, like
Horace, to dine with him. ‘Blatero ’ is to bawl, or more commonly to
babble and talk nonsense. ‘ Mulvius ’ may be anybody, one of the numer-
ous tribe of arasites. ‘ Non referenda recati,’ uttermg curses which the
servants he ‚ but must not repeat. See st Satire, v. 30, “iratis precibus.’'

37. dixerit ille] Mulvius may be supposed to mutter this, as Horace goes
off and leaves him without his expected dinner. ‘Nasum nidore supinet-,³
‘ 1 snuff up my nose at the smell of a good dinner.' ‘ Nidor’ means ‘nidor
culinae,’ as in Juv. v. 162: “ Captum te nidore suase putat ille culinae.”
² 39. si quidvis adde popina] ‘Popino' is not a common word. It means
gn ἐᾱΙὲ, dissolute fellow, a frequenter of ‘ popinae,’ cook-shops. (See above,

. . 2, n.

40. Tu -J-ultro Insectere] ‘ Are you the man to come forward and attack ‘i ’
that is, to be the first to do it. See S. 6. 30, and C. iv. 4, 51, n.

42. Quid, εἰ me] Davus goes on in his own person. Five hundred drach-
mae, reckoning the drachma and the denarius as nearly the same velue (about
ἢεί), which was the case about this time, amounts to 171. 15⁸. of English
money, and this was a small price, only given for inferior slaves. The price
varied very widely, according to the beauty of the slaves (of either sex),
which enhanced their value more than anything else, or according to their
education, or skill in handicrafts, διο. ³
ι 43. Aufer fide—tenere ,·] Literally, ‘ Away with that frightening me.’
(See Epp. i. 7. 27, n.) It expresses alarm and haste, for Davus sees his
master Ἑτοπηίηέἇοῖηᾱ lifting his hand to strike him. ¹

45. Crispini it me janitor] About Crispinus, see S. i. 1. 120, n. Davus

rofesses to have obtained at second hand, from the slave of this Stoic phi-
{isim nimii? sis? arinini. ...swern
‘ janitor,’ who was also called ‘ ostiaria} kept the door of they house. He
had a mom on each side of the ‘ ostium,’ which was a space between the
outer and inner door. Crispinus's janitor may be supposed to have over·
heard what his master had said, from time to time, to his friends, while sit·
ting in the ‘ atrium ' into which the inner door opened. ” “

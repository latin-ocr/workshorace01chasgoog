3. amat] ‘it cleaves to,' as ‘littus ama’ (Aen. v. 163). ‘Multum’ in
this sense is rather a favor-ite expression with Horace, as ‘multum demissus
homo,' S. i. 3. 57; ‘multum celer,' S. ii. 3. 147.

The possessive pronoun is used thus abruptly once before (i. 15. 32), “ non

woman is iikenedp to withered leaves which are tossed to the winde, to carry

expression is like that at the beginning of the next Ode.

 

ODE XXVI.

'l'ms Ode is an invocation of the Muse, praying her to do honor to Lamia,
respectin whom see C. iii. 17. It would appear that, at the time it was
written, the affaiis of the Parthians were occupyinffv a good deal of attention at
Rome, since Horace speaks of himself as the on one who gave no heed to
them. The circumstances'that may be sup se to be referred to are to be
gathercd from the following account. In t e year B. c. 30, Phraates (Ar-
saces XV.) being on the Parthian throne, and having by his cruelties made
himself obnoxious to his subjects, Tiridates, likewise one of the family of
Arsacidae, was set up as a rival to Phraates, but was defeated in his attempt
to ‹lethi-one him, and fied for protection that same year to Augustus, who

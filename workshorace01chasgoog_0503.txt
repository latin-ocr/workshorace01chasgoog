The sides of the couches were sometimes veneered with ivory. Fire is said
‘ candere‚' and the flaming drapery of the bed is here described by the same
word, which is not applied in this sense elsewhere. ‘ Fercula’ was the name
for the different courseS, of which the ‘coena’ usually consisted of three,
called ‘primal ‘secunda‚’ ‘tertia coena! The word, like ‘feretrum‚' con-
tains the root ‘ fer ' of ‘ fero,’ and so its first meaning may have been the tray
or dish on which the viands were brought. It here means the viands them-
selves; ‘many courses were left,’ would mean nothing. ‘Procul’ signifies
‘hard by,' as in Epp. i. 7. 32. The remains of the evening's ‘coena' had
been collected and put into basketS, and left in the ‘ triclinium ’ till the morn-

SATIRE VII.

Tm: substance of this Satire Horace puts into the mouth of his slave Da-

more stupid thau his own. He also taunts Horace with his instability and
weakness of purpose, which part of the Satire is the most natural and amus-⁸

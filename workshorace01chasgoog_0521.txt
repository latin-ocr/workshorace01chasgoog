60. et mena] ‘ Mens ' signifies passion, μένος.

’GL poenas-fielium] ‘hurries after its revenge? So Horace uses ‘pro-

rare,' in C. iii. 24. 62, “pecuniam Heredi properet '’; and in the next
{pisae (v, 28), “ Hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli.” It is like the
Greek σπεύδειν, which takes an accusative. ⁴

63. hunc tu compesce] In general precepts, emphasis is sometimes given
by the insertion of the pronoun ‘ tu.’ See C. i. 9. 16.

64. Finyit equum] Here he goes back to v, 40, “sa re aude3 Incipe.''
For to (hle lWise, he must learn, and put himself in the ands of those who
can tea · iim.

65. venaticus, ex quo] ‘ Catulus’ is awkwardly placed at the end of the
sentence. The practice of training dogs by means of stuffed animals was
perhaps common. ‘ Latro’ governs an accusative here and in Epod. v. 58.
On ‘militat,’ see S. ii. 2. 10, n.

69. Quo semel est imbuta recens] ‘ The testa keeps long the odor it imbibed 3
when new! So, he meam, the good or evil imbibed in youth clings to the
mind for many years.

70. Quodsi cessas ant strenuus anteis‚] Horace says he cannot· wait for the
dilatory, or trouble himself to keep up with those who are in a great hun-y
to get on. He means he shall go his own way in the pursuit of wisdom.
At the samo time, he hints that young persons are apt to get on a little too
fast, and to mistake their own powers and attainments. The conclusion is
,abrupt, as Horace's conclusions often am.

 

EPISTLE 111.

11« Β. c. 20 an embassy came from Armenia to Rome, expressing the dis· κ

satisfaction of the people with their king, Artaxias, and praying that Augus- ³
tus would place upon the throne that king’s younger brother, Tigranes, who
was theu living in exile at Rome. Augustus assented, and sent Tiberius
with Tigranes to dethrone Artaxias. This Tiberius did, and with his own
hand crowned Tigranes. (See Epp. 12. 27, n.
= About his person Tiberius appears to have ad a number of young men,
such as Titius, Celsus, and MunatiuS‚ mentioned in this Epistle‚ and Julius
Florus, to whom it is addressed. What little can be said about the first
three will be found in the notes. Floms, it appears from this Epistle (v, 23),

Quintilian (Inst. Orat. x. 3) tells an anecdota of one Julius Florus, whom
he calis the first man in Gaul for eloquence. This may be the person Horace
addresses‚ and if so, he carried out successfully iu Gallia the pursuit of which

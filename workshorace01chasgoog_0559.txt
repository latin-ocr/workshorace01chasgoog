test, made objections to the ground, and asked for δ’ postponement, the lan· -
guage of the arena or paloestra being kept up. The meaning, in plain terme,
is, that he does not wish to be brought into competition with others in the way
of public recitations or criticism, because such matters, though they may be-
gin in good temper, generally issue in strife and bad passione. ‘ Iste ' ex- .
presses ‘ that place which you propose.’

EPISTLE XX.

Wrrn this composition addressed to his book (which can hardly be any
other than this collection of Epistles) Horace sends it forth to take its chance
in the world. He addresses it as a young and wauton maiden, eager to es-.
cape from the retirement of her home and to rush into dangers she knows
nothing of. He tells her it will be too late to repair her error when she
discovers it; that she will be emessed for a time and then thrown away, and,
when her youth and the freshness of her beauty are gone, she will end her
days in miserable drudgery and ⁰b⁸⁰uritffis He concludes with a description

1. Vertumnum Janumque,] The Vicus Thur-arius, in which the Scholiasts
say Vertumnus had a. temple, was part of the Vicus Tuscus (S. ii. 3. 228),
and the Argiletum was a street leading out of that street. In the Argiletum
«Ianus had a temple. The Sosii were Horace’s booksellers (see A. P. 345),
and their shop ma have stood near temples of Vertumnus and Janus, at
which Horace says is book is casting longing glanceS. The Scholiasts say
they were brothers. The outside skin of the parchment-rous were polished
with pumice-stone, to make them look well.

3. Odisti claves] The ‘ capsae ³ or ‘ scrinia ’ (S. i. 4. 21, n.) were locked,
or scaled, or both3 and women and young persons were locked or sealed up
in their chambers, that they might not get into mischief, which restraint Hor-
ace says they liked, if they were chaste. He professes to reproach his book
for being tired of staying at home, and being shown only to his friends, and
wanting to go out to be exposed for sale, to which purpose hc had not trained
it. There can be no doubt that what is here distinctly said of the Epistles is
true of the other works of Horace, that they were shown to his friendS‚ and
. circulated privately before they were collected and published.

9. Quodsi non odio peccantis] ‘ But if the prophet is not blinded by his
avet-sion to the offender‚’ that is, if 1 am not led by my aversior} to your
wantonness to prophesy too harshly of your fate. ‘Aetas ’ is used for any
time kpf life, according to the context; but more frequently for old age than

Ilerda (Lerida) in Spain, or anywhere else in the remote provinces, tied up
as a bundle of goods (‘vinctus’)‚ and 1 shall laugh, for what is the usc of
trying to save such a wilful thing? as the driver said, when his ass would gio
too near the edge of the precipice, and he drove him over in a passion. t

book will be red in its oldage to the poor pcople’s schools in the back

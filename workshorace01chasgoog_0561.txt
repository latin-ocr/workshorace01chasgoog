minda ns of our own times3 and there is enough in the Epistle to account for
the high estimation it is held in by the general render.

s ἔθαψα-ἰὸν. οιπα,] See Introduction to C. ii. 15, and the Odes there re-
e to.

3. Legibus emman, The principal laws passed in the time of Augustus
are given in Smith’s ict- Δηὼ, under the head ‘Juliae Leges? See C. iii.
nffz'eondulm α mer pates-J An the-0 homes m jqined, in c. iii. 3. 9, sqq.
As to ‘Liber,' see Epp. i. 19. 4, n. There is additional confusion here by
the Latin ad‘unct ‘ pater ' being affixed to his name. Dionysus, Hercules,
castor, and ollux were the favor-ite heroes of the Greeks, who attributed
chiefly to their labora the civilization of the world, and to their care its pres-
ervation.

11. findi] The labors of Hercules are called ‘ fatales? because thereby he
fulfilled his destiny. Virgil so describes them in Aen. viii. 291.

12. Cbmpsrit inve'da'am] See C. iii. 24. 31, sq. .

13. Urit enimsulqorc sm] ‘ For that man scorches with his brightness who
ove wers capacities inferior to his own ’; that is, inferior minds are galled
by t e consciousnoes of their inferiority, and extinguished by his greatness.
‘ Artes ' here probably means attainments of any kind.

15. Praesenti tibi maturos] See note on C. iv. 5. 29, sqq„ and C. iii. 5. 1,
sqq. Augustus during hIs life refused to receive the honor of a temple at
Rome, and in the provinces he would only have them if the name of Rome
was coupled with his own. He had two of this sort in Asia Minor, and one
built by Herod the Great at Caesarea. A temple in the provinces was au
honor which the governors often enjoyed. During his life, Augustus desired
to be accounted the son of Apollo, and was represented on coins in the char-
acter of that god laying on a harp. After his death, several temples were
erected to him, au his worship was regularly established, but the altars Hor-
ace speaks of were those which were raised in the provinceS‚ like that below.

16. Jurandasque tuum per nomen] The person who swore by the altar laid
his 1]ῗέιέ upon it, and invoked the name of the divinity to whom it was con-
secra .

17. Nil orimum alia-ed This is a repetition of C. iv, 2. 37.

18. Sed tuus laic populus] They who are wise in honoring you while among
them, are not wisc in their excessivo admiration for all other things that are
old and gone, and contempt for things modern.

20. simili ratione modoque] This is the third time Horace uses this combi-
nation. See S. ii. 3. 266, 271.

23. Sicfhutor veterum] Angustus was particularly simple in his lang-uage,
and had a contempt for affectation of any kind. He would therefore, as
Orelli says, be pleased with these remarks of Horace.

24. Quas bis euinque viri nnmerum] In Β. c. 452 ten patricians were ap-
pointed, with a olute powers for one year, to draw up a code of lawa, of
which the greater part was finished in that year, and engraved upon ten
tables of ivo or bronze. In the following year the decemvirate was renewed,
with the di erence that three plebeians were elected among them, and two
more tables were added. These tables contained the fundamental principles
of Roman law to the latest times. Down to Cicero's time they were com-
mitted to memor-y by boys at school. As to ‘sanxerunt‚’ see S. ii. 1. 81, n.

foedera requm] A story is told by Livy (i. 53, sqq.) respecting the way in
which Gabii (Epp. i. 11. 7, n.) came into the hands of the Romans). Another
historiari mentions having seen a treaty made on that occasion. ‘ Gabiis ’
and ‘ Sabinis ' are both governcd by ‘cum.' Compare C. iii. 25. 2, “quae
nemora aut quos agor in specus.’' As to ‘ rigidis Sabinis‚' see C. iii. 6. 38.

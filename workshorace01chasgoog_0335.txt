Homer (Odyss. xi. 314). See Virg. (Georg. i. 280),—
“ Et conjuratos caelum rescindere fratres,

Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam

Scilicet, aulae Ossae frondosum imponere Olympum,”
where ‘ frondosum ’ explains Horaee’s ⁴ opaco? Ovid inverte the order, and
puts Pelion uppermost‚ as Horace does 2-

“ Ignibus Ossa novis et Pelion altior Ossa
Arsit.” (Fast. iii. 441.)
In the fifth book of the Fasti (v. 35, sqq.),.he attributes to the hundred-handed

nor the Gigantea. Mimas and Rha-tas were of the Gigantes. Porphyrion

thea, the nurse of Zeus, and is said to have been worn by him first in these
wars with the Gigantes. lt is occasionally found in ancient representations
of Jupiter, but more commonly of Minerva. Το account for the epithet ⁸ so-
hnntem,’ we must understand that the ‘aegis ' was taken to represent, not
onl the goat-skin folded over the breast, but also a sliield (ΙΙ. xv. 229, sqq. ),
nn a mctal breastplate, either of which it ma signify here. Homer repre-
sents both A mollo and Pallas as wearing their ather's ‘aegia'

58. avidus} This means ‘ avidus pugnae,’ as in Virg. (Aen. xii. 430),
‘⁸ Ille avidus pugnae suras dncluserat auro.” Tacitus puts the word abso-
lutely (Ann. i. 57 , “ Caesar avidas legiones quatuor in cuneos di rtit.”
In enumerating e 'princi al gods who assisted Zeus ln the battle, {orace
means to say that, although¹ they were present, it was Pallas to whom the vic-
tory was mainly owing. ee Introduction. ‘ Hinc- hinc ’; ‘ in one plaee—

59. matrona Juno] The Greek Here was commonly represented milred, or

artl so. The Roman J uno was always clad as a matron fi‘om head to foot.

61. Qui nore puro] The description of Apollo combines his various places
of abode. Castalia was a fountain on Parnassus. ‘ Lyciae ‹lumeta’ are
woods about Patara, a town ‘m Lycia, wloere Apollo passed six months of the

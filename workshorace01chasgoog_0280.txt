‘ Ι will not rouse thee against thy will, nor drag to light thy mysteries,
hidden in leaves! There were sacred things contained in small chestS,
⁴ cistae,’ which were carried in the processione at the Dionysia, covered with
the leaves of vine and ivy. Bassareus was a title of Bacchus, of =which the
origin is uncertain. It is said to be derived from βασσαρίς, the fox-skin
worn by the Bacchanals.

Tun hero of this Ode, whoever he may be, sa · that, though he had
meant to put awa love from his heart, Glycera's e arms have taken such
hold upon him, t at he can no longer sing of grave subjecta which aro

Aneuunu'r. — The mother of love, Semele’s son, and wantonness recall
m heart to love, which Ι thought Ι had· put away for ever. 1 burn for
Glycera, fairer than marble, aud the mischievous sace so dangerous to look
upon. W¹¹²h.³⁴ll her strength hath Venus come upon me, and bids me smg
no more of idle mamea—the Scythian and the Parthian. Bu1ld me an
altar, slaves fii bring boughs and incense aud wine, for I would soften the
goddess wi a victim.

1. Mater suem Cupidinum] This verse occurs again C. iv. l. 5. The
multiplication of the forms of ἔρως was derived from the Greeks by the
Romans.

3. Lacentia This is the same impersonation as the Greek Ὕβρις-

8. lubricus Forcellini derives this from the verb ‘ labor.’ ‘ Vultus lu·
bricus adspici ’ is a face dangerous to look upon, as slippery ground is
dangerous to tread upon. ⁸

10. Scythas& Under this name Horace, with the historiens of this period,
understood al nations on and beyond the Tanais, as well as those on the
north of the Danube, as the Geloni, Getae, Daci, with one or more of whom
the Romans were at this time perpetually at war. See Vix-g. Georgtiii. 31 z
“ Fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis '’; and C. ii. 13. 17: “Miles
sagittas et celerem fugam Parthi.”

11. vasis—equis] The Parthians are described as in the habit of pre-
tending to fly in battle, and, as the enemy ursued, shooting their arrows or
tiu-owing their darts at them from horsebacft).

12. quae nihil alcmena} They were nothing to a man in love.

13. vitum—caespitemst This rude sort of altar wass enjoined upon the
Israelites in the wilderness in preference to any other (Exod. xx. 24).
The word ‘ verbena' was used for an boughs employed for crowning
the altar or for sacred purpose& ‘Ver ‚⁸ and ⁴ herb ’ m ‘ herba,’ are the
same root. ,

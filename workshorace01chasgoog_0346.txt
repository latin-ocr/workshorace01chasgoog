13. Tu ] See C. i. 12. 7, sqq.

17. &m’ quamvisll This passage ma be compared with C. ii. 13. 33,
sqq. ‘ Funale,' ‘ fury- 1ke,' having snakes or hair.

21. Quin et Ῑεείοη] He was king of the Lapithae. Having treacherously
murdered his father-indam Deioneus‚ he returned the goodness of Zeus, who
purified him, by trying to seduce Here, for which Horace calls him rightly
‘ perfidus Ixion ’ (A. P. 124), and he was unished by being bound to a wheel
perpetually revolving, in HadeS. As -to fityoa see C. ii. 14. 8, ιι. For ‘ quin
et‚' see C. ii. 13. 37, n. ‘ Vultu risit invito ' is a happy description. (S. ii.
3. g} nDhnai puellus}¹ The daughters of Danaus (see C. ii. 14. 18) were pun·
ished by having to ll a vessel with a holo in the bottom. They were fift
in number, and married the fift sons of AEgyptuS‚ their uncle. At the bid,I
din of their father, who was a raid of his nephewS, they all murdered their
hus ands but Hypermnestra, who spared Lynceus, Horace puts a touching
speech into her mouth, bidding her young husband rise and fly for his lise.

27. fundo pereuntis imo] ‘ escaping by (through) the bottom.'

28. seraque fitia] ὖστεροφθόρον δίκην. See note on C. iii. 2. 32.

31. lunare] ‘ they had the heart.’ This would be expressed by ἕτλ σαν
in Greek. In a more familiar passage ‘ possum ’ occurs with the same ind

of meaning (E p. i. 5. 1) : “ Si potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis,”
‘ if you can m e u your mind)

37. Sur-92, quae elz-ill ovid has horrowed all but the words of Horace
in Hypermnestra’s letter to Lynceus, one of the most touching of his
poems’“—Surge age, Belida, de tot modo fratribus unus : .

Nox tibi ni properas ista perennis ent.’' (Her. xiv. ¹73, sq.)

ODE XII.

Tms Ode represents a girl lamentin to herself over a love she must not
indulge. Her name is Neobule‚ and t at. of the man she loves is Hebrus,
whom she represents as the perfectiou of beautiy and manliness. The Qde
appears to have been imitated, if not translated, rom one of Alaeus, ofwhich
one verse in the same metre is extant.

Auernum-r. — Poor women! we must not love, we must not drown care
in wine, or a cruel guardian scolds us to death. Alas, Neobulc ! thou canst
not s in nor work, for love of HebruS, so beautiful as he bathes in the watcrs
of Ti r, a horseman like Belerophon‚ unsurpassed in the combat and the
race, in pier-cing the flying deer or catching the lurking boar.

1. Miserarum est] ‘ It is the fate of unhappy women.’ Ι

2. aza] ‘or‚ if we do! · ο

3. Patr-uae] Compare (Sat. ii. 3. 88) “ ne sis patruus m1h1.” On the form
‘lavere,’ see C. ii. 3. 18, n.

4. qualum] ‘ my wool-basket.’ The name Neobule is found in a fragment
of Archilochus. Hebrus's birthplace is mentioned to give more reahty to
the person. Lipara, it must be admitted, was an odd place to choose. It
was one of the Vulcaniae Insulae, and is still called Lipari.

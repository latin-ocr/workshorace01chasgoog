ODE XXIX.

Tms is an invitation from the poet to his patron, pressing him to pay
him a visit at his fann. He bids him throw off the cares of the state, and
live for the enjoyment of the hour. The time is the dog-days, The year is

uncertain.

Anetnmnr.— Come, MoecenaS, the wine and oil and the fiowers are
ready. Stay not for ever gazing from a distance at the leasant fields of
Tibur, buried in the magnificence and the uproar, the weal and the smoke,
of the city. The rich man often likes to sup at the poor man's table. The
days of drought are come back3 the shepherd seeks the shade, the flock seeks
the stream, not a breath is on the river-banks z but thou art distracting thy-
self with imaginat-y dangers. Heaven has wisely hidden the future from
man, and does but smile at his feam. Live sor the present3 all else is like
the stream, that now flows in peace, newis swollen to a flood, and sweeps
all with it to the sea„ He lives happy who lives to-day, and leaves tao-morrow
to Heaven, seeing that Jove himself cannot undo what is done.

As to Fortune, she is sickle, and changes from day to day. If she stays
with me, Ι am glad ; if she flies,J am resigned. 1f the storm rageS, I have

6. Ne semper adum] ‘ Udum ' is an epithet commonly a plied to Tibur,
which stood on the banks of the Anio. The town itself was uilt on the side
of a hill (C. iii. 4. 23), but the fields below seem to have been (lamp (see C. i.
7. 14) from a number of small streams which watered them. It appears that
Maecenas was sighing for the country all the time he was detained at Rome.
Telegonus, son of Ulysses and Circe, was the reputed founder of Tusculum
and Praeneste. One of the legende of the death of Ulysses attributes it to
this son. AEsula was probably a town between Praeneste and Tibur, but no
traces of its site remam, and Pliny says that it uo longer existed in his
tIme iii. 5). 2

16. Sollicitam explicuere frontem] This expression is repeated in Sat. ii. 2.

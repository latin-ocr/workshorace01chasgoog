EPISTLE 11.

Tne person to whom this Epistle and the eighteenth are written, was prob-
ably the son of M. LollinS, the consul, addressed in the ninth Ode of the fourth
Book. He was young, but had becn with Augustus to the wara as we leam
from the other Epistle (v. 55). When this Epistle was written, he was at
Rome, centinuing his education, and Horace was at Praeneste. He had
lately been reading Homer, and from the examples of the Iliad and Odyssey
hc takes occasion to derivo some advice for Lollius, whom he urges to the
,study of philosophy.

1. maxime Lolli, This is probably no more than a familiar and good-
humored way of dressingthe voung man, ‘ most noble Lollius.'

2. Dum tu declamas Romae] Horace writes to Lollius as to one familiar
with Homer’s-poema He says of himself, referring ιο his early education at
Rome (Epp. u· Ξ '132th nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri

Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.”

After the Romans had begun to expand the course of their sons' education,
(as mentioned in the note on S. i. 6. 7 7,) Homer was one of the first authors
⁸ a boy studicd. Boys attended the schools of the rhetorical masters before
they put on the ‘toga viriIiS,’ and there they learnt to declaim upon subjecta
given them from histor . This practice was not introduced till the later
years of the republie. oung men continued studying declamation long
after they left school. They had teachers at home, who taught them the
higher principles of orator-y.

Praeneste releyi ,·] Praeneste (Palestrina) was in Latium, about twenty-

 

three miles due east of Rome. on the edge of the Apennines. It was a cool ’ ’

retreat, to which Horace appears sometimes to have gone in summer, even
when he had a place of his own elsewhere. See C. iii. 4. 21, sqq.

4. Chrysippo et Crantore] As to Chr sippus the Stoic‚ see S. i. 3. 126,st
Both he and Crantor were born at the ilician town Soli. Crantor studied
philosophy in the Academia, under Xenocrates and with Polemo. (See S. ii.
3. 254, n.) They were both voluminous writerS. But Horace says there is
more instruction in the poems of Homer than in all they ever wrote, and that
it is more clearly conveyed. Horace takes a wrong view of Homer's poems,
which are not philosophical, nor meant ιο be so, but noble specimens of art
and poetical conception. - ·

7. Barbariae] rhat ie, Phrygia. (See Epod. ix. 6.) ‘Aestus ' is a met-
aphor from the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and represents the passione
and variableness of the princes and people.

9. Antenor censet] At a meeting of the Trojan chiefs after the combat of
Hector and Ajax, Antenor proposes to restore Helen to the Greeks, which
Paris flatly refuses, ἀντικρὺ δ’ ἀπόφημι γυναῖκα μὲν οὐκ ἀποδώσω (11. vii.
Βδῗὲῗζῗιίζν Peliden—inter Atriden 5] See S. i. 7. 11, n. Epp. 1. 25,.n.

13. Hunc amor‚] From its position this seems to belong to ‘An-iden?
The allusion is to Nestor's attempt to mediate between Agamemnon and
Achilles, when the former angrily consents ιο restore Chryseis, whom he
loved above clytemnestra his wife (Il. i. 113, sqq.).

19. domitor Dojae] The epithet πτολίπορθος is frequently applied to

Ulysses by Homer. The three first verses of the Odyssey are almost trans-
lated in these lines.

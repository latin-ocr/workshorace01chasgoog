quem ter vindicta quaterque] ‘Vindicta’ is used for the ‘ festuca: or rod,
laid upon the shoulder of a slave by the praetor, in the act of giving him his
freedom. Davus says that manumission, repeated over and over again
(though that involves an absurdity), could not deliver his master, as he
called himself, from the bondage he was under to the world.
73. ¹{lelclle sirpea- dictas] ‘ Dictis ' is governed by ‘ adde,’ and ‘ snper ’ is
use a so ute

79. uuna-iuss The property a slave might accumulate was called his ‘ e-
euliumss and among the rest he might have a ‘vicarius,' a slave to do is
duty or help him in it. He was held to be ‘quasi dominus’ in relation to
his ‘ vicarius! What Davus says is, whether you choose to call the slave's
slave his ‘vicariuS,' or substitute, as your law does, or his fellow-slave (as
strictly speakin he is, for, except by sufferance, a slave can hold no pro rty
independent offfiis master), what is my relation to you ’ἒ 1 am your sigor-03
you are the slave of your passione, which will pull you about as the strings

pull a puppet (which the Greeks called νευρόπαστον). Tm ancicnts car-
ried their mechanical skill in the construction of automaton figures further,
perhaps, than it has been carried since. Artisoe in this line were common
among the Greeks, and were called νευρόσπασται, αὖτοματουργοί. It ap-
pears from Herodotus (ii. 48) that ἀγάλματα νευρόσπαστα, as he calls them,
were in use among the Egyptians,

- 83. sibi qui imperiosus‚] ‘ He who has control over himself? Before
Horace, no writer uses this word with a case after it.

85. Responsura cupidinibus,] ‘Responso ' is repeated in Epp. i. 1. 68.
“Fortunae responsare superbae.’' It seems to mean, to reply to on equal
terms, and so to be a match for, and to overcome. 'Phe construction of the
{idjoetigsseassd infinitive is common in the Odes, but not in the Satires or Epis-

es. . i. 1. 16, n.

86. in se ipso totus, teres, atque rotunda-§J ‘ In himself entire, smoothed,
and rounded‚' that is, rfect as a sphere, and, as the next line explains,
like a beautiful statue νεεδ-ο graees are all in itself, which is perfectly finished
and polished. This is elsewhere expressed by ‘ ad unguem sactus homo'
(S. i. 5. 32, n.), the difference in the mode of expression being, that here it
is meent there are no inequalities on the surface on which anythmg at all can
rest. The other expression has been explained in its lace. ‘ In se ipso
totus,' means one who wants nothing from without to set 'm off, and whose
meumes, as well as his graces, are all in himself. The mud through which
he pasees as he goes through the world does not adhere to him (‘ externi ne
quid valeat per leve morari '); circumstances, prosperous or the reverse, do
not affect his char-actem and, in all her assanlts upon his happiness, For-tune
proves but feeble‚ not being able to make any impression upon it. ‘ Mancus'
means lame in the hand, as ‘ claudus ’ does in the foot. .‘ Teres ' rs ex-
plained in a note on C. i. l. 28. ‘Rotundus’ is taken from the heavens,

which Plato (Tim. p. 33) says the Deity σφαιροειδὲς ἐτορνεύσατο, as being
most after his own image.

 

ι 89. Quinque talenta] The Attio drachma of this period was worth about ’

the same as the Roman denariae, nearly sssd. (See above, v. 43, n.) The
mina was equal to loo drachmae, and a talent to 60 minae. It was worth
therefore about 212l„ and five talents 1,06οἱ. The caprice of the man’s mis-
tress is described as before, S. 3. 260, sqq.

92. Non quin 5] This is the second person of ‘quem'

95. Parauaea torpes, insane, tabelhu] Pausias was a native of Sicyon, one
of the most celebrated schools of art, where there was a large collection of
his pictures. Many were sold by the Sic onian goverriment, to pay their
debts, and most of these found their way to {tome His pictures were ch1efly
small, ‘tabellae‚' and mnong the most celebrated was the pertrait „of- ‚his

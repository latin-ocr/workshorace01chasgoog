Horace at his farm. He promises her peace and plenty, and security from
the jealousy of her husband or lover, CyruS.

Amnum-r. -— TyndariS, often doth Pan leave Lycaeus to visit LucretiliS‚
protecting my flocks from sun and wind} my goats go unharmed, and fear
not snake or wolf, when his sweet pipe sounds in the vale of Ustica. The
gods love me for my iety and my muse. Hero Plenty awaits thee; hero
shalt thou retirc from t 10 11001, and sing of the loves of Penelope and Circe
for Ulysscs. Here shalt thou quaff mild Lesbian wine in the shade, nor
shall strife be minglcd with the cup, nor shalt thou fear lest the jealous Cyrus
lay his violent hand upon thee.

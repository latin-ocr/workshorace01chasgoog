tory, and remains of it are still in existence near Castel Giubileo. · In B. c.
425 the town was destroyed by AEmilius Mamercus (Liv. iv. 9), and it seems
never to have risen to any great importance again. ,

Gabii and Fidenae were proverbially joined together (see Juv. S. x. 99).

where, it· may be observed‚ Virgil shortens the first syllable, whereas Horace
and Juvenal and Silius (xv. 91) make it long.

tamen illic vivere vellem] Horace seems to mean that, though Lebedus was
a place deserted‚ he could enjoy living there, though it cut him off from all
his friends, for the sake of the fine prospect it gave of the sea, which would
be an exaggerated way of speaking. Hc had probably in mind some occa-
sion when he had admired the sea from Lebedus, and the recollection came -

⁴ But: he goes on to sgy, P{heere is a time for all things. Thegt-ffiveller, when
he gets splashed‚ may be glad of a tavern to retire to and clean himself, but
he would not wish to stay there all his life3 and the man who has got chilled
may be glad of a flre or hot bath, but he does not reckon fires and hot baths
the chief good of life 3 and though you may have been glad to get on shore
in a foreign land, to escape from a storm, you will surely not think it neces-
sary to stay there for ever. 1f a man is in health, Rhodes and M tilene are
not the places for him; so come back again while you may, and i you must

1¹⁵1. qui Capua Romam] The road Appius made (n.c. 312) extended only
as far as Capua. It was afterwards extended to Beneventum, and then on
by two different branches to Brundisium (see S. i. 5. 79, n.). ,

12. nec qui Friqvts colleqic} ‘ Colligere ' is not used in this sense elsewhere.
The meaning is, he who has got chilled. ‘Furnos' may be bakers’ evene,
or any fornaces to which a man might go to warm himself. ·

17. Incolumi] See S. ii. 3. 137, n.

18. Paenula solstitio, campestre] The ‘ paenula ' was a thick enter mantle
worn in bad weather over the toga. The ‘campestre’ was a linen eloth
worn round the loins, in gamos or exercises in which the body was otherwise
stripped, as also in swimming.

26. effusi late maris arbiter] That is, a place which commands (as we say)
a wide prospect over the sea, such as Lebedus was described to be above.
The south wind is called ‘ arbiter Hadriae ’ in a different sense in C.
i. 3. 15.

become proverbial for a do-nothing activity, such exertions as tend to no

astened by traces), though the word is more generally used for a triumphal
or racing chariot than for a travelling carriage‚ of which there were various
kinds. ‘Rheda’ was the most general name for such a cai-riage on four
wheels (see S. ii. 6. 42, n.). ‘Petorritum' was another name, and a third
was ‘ carruca,’ a later name, not known in Horace's time. There were others,
each differing more or less from the rest: ‘ cisium,' ‘ essedum‚' ‘cai-pentum:

‘ pilentum,’ ‘ euvinus?

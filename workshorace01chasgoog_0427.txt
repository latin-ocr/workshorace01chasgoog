something like it Upi-o ’ S. ii. 3. 32), Horace follows an Epicurean nofion.
One of the dogmas of picurus appears to have been, that justice was-noth-

99. Cum prorepserunt] He goes on to illustrate this doctrine, saying that
men lived at first like beasts, till expediency taught them to make laws„

102. usual Here this signifles ‘ need! It generally occurs (in this sense)
in combination with ‘ est ’ or ‘ venit.’

103. Donec verba] ‘Verba nominaque’ embraees all the parts of speech,
like the Greek ὀνόματα καὶ bima-ra. (A. P. 234.) ‘Notae ' are symboIS, as
in short-hand writing for instance ; and this line may perhaps be most accu-
rately rendered, ‘ till they invented language, whereby they could give a
symbolica} form to the sounds of their vorce, and to their feelmgs.'

110. Viribus editior] ‘ Superior in strenffih? ‘ Editus ’ is used for ‘ex-
alted,’ ‘ high? It nowhere else appears in e sense Horace gives it here.

111. Jara inventa metu injusti] If this be admitted, as of course it must be,
then Injustice —- and, if 80, J astice —was anterior to any laws or social eom-
pact, express or implied3 so that the doctrine above laid down falls to the
ground ; and that justice of which expediency is said to be the mother, turns
out to be nothing more than magistrates’ justice, —the justice of statutes,
which may be just or unjust.

112. evolvere] This word, which signifies ‘to read,' is taken from the un-
rolling of a parchment ‘ usque ad umbilicum! See Epod. xiv. 8, n. As to
‘fastos,' see C. iii. 17. 4, n. Epp. ii.1. 48, n.

114. bona diversis‚] ‘ Bona' means things which it is good to have and to
get, not virtues, but the ‘fts of fortune and such like.

115. Nx vincet ratio oc,] ‘ Nor will any logic prove this! ‘ Vincere
causam ' is an ordinary expression for winning a cause. ‘ Idem ' is explained
by ‘ tantundem,' the same in degree of guilt.

117. sacra diuum leym-it] ‘ Legcre ’ is not uncommonly used in the sense
of robbin . Hence our word ‘sacrilege’

119. liz scutica diynum] The epithet ‘ horribili' belongs to ‘flagello‚'
which was a severer instrument tha-n the ‘scutica,’ and was sometimes eon-
structed with horrible cruelty, and fatal in its application. The ‘ scutica'
had but one thong, of leather. ‘ Ferula ’ was a switch, usually from the vine.

The Latin derivatives from σκῦτος are short in the first syllable. There are

other instances (as ‘anchora' from ἅ κῦρα, ‘crepida’ from κρηπίς, etc.) in

which the quantity of the Greek vowel is changed in the Latin.

120. atserula caedas] The rule in respect to verbs of fearing is that “ the
Latin inserts a negative where the English has none, and vice versa,'' that is
‘ vereor ne’ means ‘-I fear it will ' ; ‘vereor ut,' ‘ I fear it will not.’ There
is no deviation from the rule here3 for the osition of ‘ut' makes it inde-

ῃ 122. Furta latrociniis] This is not strictly a technical distinction, nor is
‘latrocinium ³ a technical term. All robbery was ‘ furtum,' whether attendcd
with violence or not ; but Horace means to distinguish bctwccn thefts with-
out viiolence and robbery with violence (‘ rapina’). ‘ Cum dicaS,’ ‘ though

another doctrine of t e Stoics not connected with the main subject of the
Satire, namel , that the sago is the only rich, capable, handsome man, and a
king. The a surdity of the doctrine, which is repeated in Epp. i. 1. 107,

brosus ’ is au old word signifying ‘ cholerie! ‘ Dolare ’ is properly to trim a

icce of wood with au axe, ‘ dolabra) ‘ He rough-hewed him with a cudgcl.'

t is only here used in this sense. Feronia was a goddess, worshipped origi-
nally by the Sabines. On the site of the temple near which Horace and liis
party disembarked, there now stands an old tower‚ bearing the name Turre
Ottofacia. Horace says they only washed their hands and face, which would
be no little refreshment after a night spent in a canal-boat.

25. Miltia tum pransi tria repimus] Three miles further, on the top of a
steep ascent, stood the town of Tarracina (Terracina), which by the Vol-
scians was called Anxur, by which name it is always mentioned by the poets.
The winding of the road up the hill, and the difficulty of the ascent, explains
the word ‘ repimus.' The old town of Tarracina was built on the top of the
hill, but this site was afterwards abandoned, and a new town built on the

lain· belom close upon the shore, which is the site of the modern Terracina.

t was in Horace’s day, and had been for a long time, and long continued to
be, a town of great importauce, as it was one of great antiquity. The build-

dium ' was a light meai, usually eaten about noon, but sometimes earlier, as
probabl was the ease in this instance.

27. uc venturus erat] See Introduction. L. Cocceius Nerva was a friend
of M. Antonius, and was among those whom Augustus found in Perusia
when he took it (Β. c. 41). He offered these persons no indignity‚ but made
friends of them, and Cocceius seems to have become especially intimate with
AugustuS, without betrayiug his friendship for Μ. AntoniuS.

29. aversos soliti componere amicos] After the taking of Perusia, war was
threatened betwcew Augustus and AntoniuS, which was averted by an ar-

He was deputed b Augustus on this occasion, as being a particular friend
of M. Antonine, w o afterwards, as Plutarch relates (Anton 36), sent him,
while he was in Syria, to fuich Cleopatra. thither from Egypt. The expres-
sion ‘ ad unguem factus ' is taken from the crast of the sculptor, who tries the
sui-face of his statue by passing the nail over it · if the parts be put perfeetly
together, and the whole work well finisbcd, the nail passes over the suiface,
and meets with no obstruction. See PersiuS‚ S. i. 64. Compare also A. P.
294. Below (S. ii. 7. 86) the perfect man is described as

“in se ipso totu8‚ teres atque rotundus,
Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari,’'
which is like the description of the text, though the metaphor is not quite the
same.

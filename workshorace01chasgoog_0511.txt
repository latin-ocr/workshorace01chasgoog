496 noras. ’

finger was called ‘ famosus! This name is given to it as the finger of seem.
The third finger was called ‘ medicus ' or ‘ medicinalis,' for the same rea-son
probably that got it the name ‘ annularis,’ its supposed anatomical connec-
tion with the beart. By ‘ cetera turba' Fundanius means the uninitiated,
Maecenas and his party.

29. Ue vel comitano ματαίῃ] The nature and importance of the duties of
Nomentanus were shown ou that occasion, when he handed Fundanius a
*duint he had never tasted before, or perhaps heard of, and yet these gentle-
meu ’new what good living was,

11ζισοαεεενιέ] ‘ Passer ’ was a flat fish, and *is generally supposed to be the
ree.
p 31. melimela] These were a sweet sort of rosy apple. The derivation of
the name sufficiently marks their ssavor. That they had a higher color when
gathered at the wane of the moon, is an invention of the nomenclator. His
reasoning on the subject was so abstruse, that Fundanius does not pretend to
be able to recollect it.
34. Nos nisi damnose bibimus] See Terence (Heaut. v. Δ. 9) :—
“ 012. At ego si me metuis mores cave esse in te istos sentiam.
Ol. Quof? Gk. Si scire vis ego dicam: germ, iners, fraus, helluo, Ganeo,
amnosuS.''
Vibidius meam, that if this stupid dinner is to be the death of thern, they had
better have their revenge beforehand, and drink ruinously of the host's wine ι
if the do not, they will die unavenged. ‘ Moriemur inulti ’ is bon-owed from
the pic style. See Aen. ii. 6703 iv. 659.

35. Vertere pallor Tam parochi faciem] Fundanius gives two reasons why
the host turned pale when he heard his guests call for larger cups ; because
when men have drank well they give a loose rein to their tongues, and because
wine spoils the palate by destroying the delicacy of its taste. He might prob-
ably have added a third, for it seems that in the midst of his ostentation the
man was a niggard. As to ‘ parochi,' see S. i. 5. 46. The host is so called
as the man “ qui praebet aquam '' (S. i. 4. 88).

39. Insertum Altaesam's vinaria tota] Allifae was a town of Samnium.
From the text we are led to suppose that cups were made there. ‘ Vinaria'
is properly an adjective, and agrees with ‘ vasa ’ understood. It means here
·the ‘lagena’ or ‘amphora,’ which differed in shape, but not in use. Both
were vessels either of clay, or sometimes latterly of glaSS, in which the wine
was ke t. Their contente were usually pom-cd into a ‘ crater' for the pur.
pose o being mixed with water. These persons helped themselves from the
‘ lagena,' and all followed their example, except the master and his two par-
asites (see above, v. 2ο). There was no ‘ magister bibendi,' and the guests
drank as they pleased.

42. squillas inter muraena natantes] As to ‘squillas,' see S. ii. 4. 58. ‘Mu-
raena’ was a lamprey, and accounted a great delicaey by the Romans, who

” of which the host goes on to describe himself, as a matter of too much conse-
quence to be left to the explanation of his nomenclator. The materials were
Venafrian olive-eil (C.- ii. 6. 16. n.); ‘garum‚' a sance made of the entrails
and blood of fish, and here made from the scomber, perhaps the niackerel,
caught in greatest abundance off the coast of Spain; some Italian wine
added while it was making, and some Chian when it was made3 white pep-
per (see above, 4. 74, n.), and vinegar made from sour Lesbian wine (C. i. 17.
21). Of the other ingredients Nasidienus boasts of having invented two him-
se1f3 one was the ‘eruca,' which we call the rocket, and the ‘inula campa-
na‚’ ‘elecampane,' a lant that grows in meadows and dam ground. It is
used medicinally-as a guter. The last ingl-edient was the ‘ ce nnus} a prickly

from the Epistle to Florus, that Horace at this time had to resist
the urgency of friends begging him to write, -οιιο in this style
and another in that, and that he had no desire to gratify them
and to sacrifice his own ease to a pursnit in which it is plain he
never took any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less
energy as his life was drawing prematurely to a close, thmgh
infirmities either conti-acted or aggravated during his iia-atione]
campaigning with Brutus, his inaptitude for which he appears ⁴
afterwards to have been perfectly aware of. He continued to
apply himself to the -study of ‘moral philosophy. till his death,
which took place, according to Eusebius, on 'the §mh of Novem-
ber, Β. ο. 8, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and within a
· few days of its completion. Maecenas died the same year, also
towards the close of it; a coincidence that has led some to the
notiomshat Horace hastened his own death that he might not
have the, pain of surviving his patron. According to Suetonius,
-his death (which he places after his fifty-nium year) was so
sudden, that he had not time to execute his will, which is opposed
to the.notion of suicide. ’ The two *friends were buried near one
'another “ in extremis Esquiliis,” in the farthest part of the Es-
quiliae, that is, probably, without the city walls, on 'the gmund
drained and laid out in gat-dens 'by Maecenas. (See S. i. 8, In·
'troduction.) · - Α

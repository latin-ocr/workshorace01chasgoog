⁰ -fnaem‘culg l{imr'ffihis ma)V mean either the chariot (formed from ‘ curro,’ as
‘ vehiculum’ rom ‘ veho ) or the course.

4. cbueyisse] The perfect is used to express the frequent repetition of the
action, like the Greek aorist. The best illustration of what follows is in the
Iliad (xxiii. 338, sqq.). ‘Meta' was the conical pillar at the end of the
course round which the chariots turned on their way back to the starting-

place. By the Greeks it was called νῦσση. It was the mark of a skilful
driver to turn the goal as closely as possible without touching it, which is
implied in ‘ fervidis Evitata rotis.

6. Terrarum dominos] That is, the Romans. Virgil (Aen. i. 282) calls
· them ‘⁸ Romanos rerum dominos.'’ .

8. ter-yemim‘s] This refers to the three curule magistr-acies, those of the
aedile, preater, and consul. Thongh the quoestorship was usually the first
step in the 'line of promotion, it is not included, because it was not a curule
office. ⁴ Tergeminus ’ here signifies no more than ‘ triplex! ‘ Geminus ’ is
used in this combination with cardinal numbers frequently. ⁹ So Virgil
(Aen. vi. 287) calls Briareus ‘ centumgeminus! ‘ Honoribus is the ablativo
case, as (C. i. 21. 9) : “ Vos Tempe totidem tollite laudibuS.” Tac. Ann. i. 3:
“ Claudium Marcellum pontificatu et curuli aedilitate—EAgrippam gemi-
natis consulatibus extulit-'³

Cenat -— telam] The poets, following the Greek idiom, nse for conven-
ience and conciseness this construction of the infinitive with verbS, which in
prose would require ‘ ut ' with the subjunctive, or a su ine, or ‘ ad ’ with a
gerund or some other construction. In the next Ode we ave “ egit visere’' ς
in the l2th, “ sumis celebrare '' ; in the 26th‚ “ tradam rtare,” and so on.
Verbs of all kinds signifying desire and the reverse are requently used with
the infinitive, as in this Ode : “ demere spernit,” ‘⁴ refugit tendere '’ ; C. 9.
13, “ fuge quaerere,” Soc. Propertius uses the infinitive after ‘ ire,’ which
the prose writers never do: “Ibat et hirsutas ille videre feras '’ (i. 1. 12).

10. de Libycis verritur arcia] The great mass of the corn consumed at
Rome was imported from Sicily and Libya. See C. iii. 16. 26, 31. S. ii. 3.
87. The ‘ area' was a raised floor on which the corn was threshed; and,
after the wind had winnowed it, the floor was swept, and the corn was thus

ma m an area.

11. Jindeoe sarculo] There is something of contempt in thes’e wordS‚ where
we should have expected ‘arare.' The soil must be poor that was worked
by a hoe, and the owner ‘macro auper agello! (Epp. ii. 2. 12.) ‘ Scin·
dere ' is the proper word for the pfough ς ‘ findere,' for the hoe or lesser in·
struments. — ‘ Attalicis conditionibus ’ signifies ‘ the most extravagant tei-ms.⁹
There were three kings of Pergamus of this name, which was proverbial for
richeS. The third left his great wealth to the Romans (B. 0. 134). See C. ii.
18. 5. ι Compare for ‘ conditionibus ’ Cic. aanu. Fr. i. 2. 8: '“ Nulla conditio,
Pe3fflffnssgvggsfluminrgfftsshggmssitgagfflgxgpffde,' ‘ down from,’ ‘ demoveo ⁹ is
more properly used when the place from which the removal takes place is

s ance, emove is e ro r re m m . iv. . ε “ urvo n c aciem
littore demovet.'' The PjblISpSe. have iffi many instances ‘ dimovet ' where
⁴ demovet ’ is wanted. The same remark applies to ‘ diripio ’ and ‘ deripio.’.
— ‘ Cypria,' ‘ Myrtoum,' ‘Icariis ' (C. iii. 7. 21), ‘ Africum,' are all particular
names for general, as ‘ Bithyna carina ' (C. i. 35. 7). By adding names more
life is given to the description. — Horace’s epithets for Africus, which was

the west-southwest wind, and corresponded to the Greek λίψ, are ‘ praeceps,’

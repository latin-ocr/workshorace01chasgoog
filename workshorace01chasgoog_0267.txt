ἀντίπαλ’ αὖθις ἐκεῖσε διπτύχῳ γλώσσᾳ

φίλα τὰ π ὁτερ’ ἄφιλα τιθέμεμενος πάντων.

Latin form of ‘ Ulysses.’

talus, the founder of his house, sei-ved up his own son {elops at a feast of
the gods, Pelops, restored to life, murdered OEnomaus his father-in·law

wife of his cousin, Agamemnon (the son of Atreus), who was murdered by
the said wife clytemnestra, and she by her son OresteS, who was pursucd to
madness by the Erynnyes of his mother: all of which events fumished
themes for the Greek tragedians, and were by them varied in their features
as suited their purpose, or according to the different legende they followed.

war with PompeiuS, after Caesar’s death attached himself to the republican
part , but very soon afterwards joined Augustus; theu followed Antonius
to t e East, and B. c. 32, the year before Actium, joined Augustus again.

Tibur. As Teucer, though driven from his father's home, bound poplar
on his head, and cheered his companionS, saying: “Let us follow fortune,

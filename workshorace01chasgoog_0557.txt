utriusque linguae ’³ (C. iii. 8. 5). Cratinus, though he lived to a good old

proverbial drunka .

tendantS, the FannS, ans, and Sat rs, see note on C. ii. 19. 4. The poets
immediately under the protection o Dionysus were the l Tic, the dithyramb
having been performed first at the Dionysia. Compare . i. l. 31. So the

whom he had only this in common, that he presided over vines. ‘ Ut ' means

5. Vana fere dulces] he ancients did not spare the reputation of their
poets in this matter3 for besides the fame of Cratinus mentioned above,
Alcaeus, Anacreon, AEschylus, Aristophanes, and many others, have the
credit of indulgin freely in wine. As to Homer, there is no foundation
in his poetry for {lorace’s libel, which is simply absurd. David might as
well be charged with excaes because he speaks of wine as makiri¹g¹ lad the
heart of man. Ennius said of himself that he only wrote when e
the gont z “ Nunquam poetor nisi podager.''

8. I-'omm putealque Libonis] See S. ii. 6. 35, n. Horace speaks as if he
had delivered an ‘ edictum ' that the business of the Forum was only fit for

stronger word for ‘ olere,' used above, v. 5.

12. Quid, siquis vultu ton-0] Cato of Utica is here resen-ed to, of whom
Plutarch says, that from his childhood he shewed in his voice and counte-
nanee, and also in his amusements, an immovable, nnim nessive, and firm
temper. He seldom laughed, or even smilcd3 and thoug not passionum,
when his anger was roused it was not easy to pacify him. He set himself
against the fashions of the times, in dress as in other things, and often went
out of deors after dinncr without his shoes and tunic ; and the fashion being
to wear a ‘lacerna ’ of bright color, he chose to wear a dark one. (Cat. c.
1. 6.) He may have worn his toga of smaller dimensione than other people,
from the same dislike to the usages of the day. For ‘ textore ’ we should
expect ‘ textura ’ in this lace.

15. Rupit Iarbitam εἰηαῃεηίσ] It a pears that the person here called
Iarbitas (from Virgil's Numidian king, arbas) was a Mauritanian by birth,

18. biberent exsufflans cuminum] The fruit of this plant, which is a pleasant
condiment, is described bv Pliny (xx. 15) as giving a pallid hue to the eom-

the proverbial use of the name by our Lord in his denunciation of the Phari-
sees, who gave tithes of mint, anise, and eumin, but neglected the weightier
matters of the law, It was used to express littleness or meanness in any
shape. Horace says, if he happened to look pale by any chance, his im-

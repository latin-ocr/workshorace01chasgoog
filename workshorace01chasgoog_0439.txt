slept, and proeeeded next morning to Fundi (Fondi), sixteen miles farther to
the northeast of Tarracina. Fundi was situated on the north shore of a lake,
which was called aster it Fundanus ; and also Amyclanus, from an old Greek
town Amyclae, the existence of which was only traditional when Homoe
wrote, but is occasionally mentioned by the poets. Fundi was one of that
class of towns called ‘praefectura,' which, instead of having the administra.-
tion of its own affairs, was governed by a ⁴ raefectus' sent annually from
Rome by the Praetor Urbanus. At this time the ‘ raefectus ³ was one Aufi-
dius Luscus (not otherwise known), an u start w om Horace calls Praetor
by way of ridicule. The officers of the ot er munici al towns were allowed
to wear the ‘ toga praetexta‚’ the ‘ toga ’ with a purple {order (Livy xxxiv, 7),
but the ‘ praefecti ’ were not, and yet Luscus wore it. The ‘latus clavus ³
was a broad purple stripe down the front of the tunic, and was a badge that
belonged only to senators. ‘ Prunae batillum ' was a pan of hot eoaIS, which

scribe, the party move on, in the course of the day, to Formiae (Mola di
Gaeta), about twelve miles farther, where the mad, having taken an upward
bend from Tarracina to Fundi, goes stmicrht down from thence to the coast,
where Formiae was situated at the head of⁹ the Sinus caietanus. Its supposed
identity with the Laestrygonia of Homer has been noticed before (C. iri. 16.
34, n.‚ and 17, Int.). As the scene of Cicero's frequent retirement, and his
death, it is a place of much interest Its wines Horace mentions more than
once. He here calls it the city of the Mamurrae, — a family of respectability
in this town. When the party got to Formiae, having travelled upwards of
twenty-five miles, they were tired, and resolved to plass the night there. Li-
cinius Murena (C. ii. 10, Int ), having a house at t is lace, gave them the
use of it; but as he was not there himself, and probably ad no establishment
in the house suitable to the entertainment of such guests‚ Fonteius Capito
invited his fellow-travellers to dine with him. He therefore appears to have
had a house at Formioe likewise.

40. Sinuessae] Leaving Formiae next day, the party set out for Sinuessa,
eighteen miles distant. The road crossed the Liris (C. i. 31 7) at Minturnae,
and went down the coast till it reached Sinuessa, the. most southerly of the
Latin towns, The site is now called Monte Dragone (Cramer). It was on
the sea, and said to have been founded on the ruins of the Greek city Sinope.
Strabo (v. 234) derives its name from the Sinus Vescinus on which it stood.
Plotius Tucca a pears to have been a native of Cisalpine Gaul. He was
associated with E Varius Rufus by Virgil, who loved them both, as the
executor of his will, and he was employed in the task of editing the AEnerd
after his death. Nothing more is known of him, but what we gather from
this passage and S. i. 10. 81, that he was one of Maecenas's friends, and on
intimate terms with Horace. As to L. Varius, see C. i. 6- 1. S. i. 10. 44.

45. Proxima Campano ponti] After Sinuessa, the Appia Via continued to
take a southerly directim, and crossed the Savo (Savone) about three miles
from that town, and just within the borders of Campania. That river was
crossed by a bridge bearing the name Pons Campanus, near which was a
small house erected for the accommodatiori of persons travelling on public
business, where there were officers appointed to supply them with ordinary

necessaries. Hence they were called ‘ parochi‚' from the Greek παρέχειν.
Ιιι this house the party passed the night.

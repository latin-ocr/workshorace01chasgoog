the Jugurthine, rather than any of the other African wars, is refened to, be-
cause Sallust's history had lately come out, aud was attractin much attention.
29. chais non Latino] In this and the following stanza orace am lifies a
little. But during the civil wars of Julius Caesar, S ain, Greece, au Africa
were scenes of much bloodshed, and Romans song t against each other at
Mutina, at Phili i, and at Actium. That the Parthian had heard the crash
of Italy in its , is a poetica] e ration, meaning, in plain prose, that
the bittercst enemy of Rome had watcffied her dissensione, and rejoiced in the
prospect of her downfall.

wealth‚ dedicated it to C. Sallustius Crispus, grand-nephew of the historian,
and inheritor of his property. He had previously alluded 'to him in no
'-'ter1ns of praise in Sat. 1. 2. 4,8ς but that Satire was written many years

and possessed of great riches, of which Horace implies that he made a

352 nome.

neuun. -1 have built myself a monument which storms shall not
destroy, nor Time himself. 1 shall not die, but' live in freshness of fame so
long as the world endures,

It will be said, 011 1116 banks of my native river, that 1, a humble man made
great, was the first to fit the Grec-ian strain to the lyre of Italy.

Put on the bay that thou hast earned‚ my Muse.

2. situ] This word is nowhere else used in this sense. It here signifies the
building, and not the site.

3. impotem] This word is equivalent to ‘ impotens sui,' ‘ violent‚' ‘ intem·
perate! See E d. xvi. 62.

imus shall, on the Ides of every mouth, go up to the Capitol to offer sacrifice,
the Vestal virgins walking silenti in the procession,’ as they did, and the boys

a} the same time sang hymns. ith a Roman this was equivalent to saying
ἳιὸῗῒιιῖκιν qua violens obstrepit Aufidus] See Introduction and C. iv. 9. 2, n.

‘ Violens ' is not a common form of ‘ violentus! It occurs again Epp. i. 10.
37, and in Persius (Sat. v. 171), “nunc ferus et violens.” ‘ Obstrepere ’ is
used absolutely again, Epod. ii. 27. ,

11. Et qua pauper aquae] ‘ Pauper' takes a genitive in S. i. 1. 79; ii. 3.
142. As to Daunus, see C. i. 22 14, n. Apulia was badly watered. Horace
calls it elsewhere ‘ Siticulosa’ (Epod. iii. 16, n).

12. Reynavit] This word, though it is used in the passive voice (see last
Ode, v. 27), here only has a noun after it. Horace gives-it the genitive, in
imitation of ὅρ ειν. Η6 wrote with his mind fullos Greek constructione and
words, and too ’ 1116 liberty of using· them very freely.

ea: humili potens‚] Horace uses the expression ‘potentium vatum ' iu the
eighth Ode of the next book (v. 26). He considered Alcaeus and Sa pho as
his chief ‘models in lyrie poen-y, which he sums up in the formula ‘ eolium
cannen ’ here and in C. iv. 3. 12. ‘Delphica lauro ’ is the same as ‘laurea

Apollinari ’ in the next book- (0,. iv. 2. 9).

ODES.—BOOK IV.

ODE 1.

I’r is said that Augustus wished Horace to publish another book of odes,
in order that those he had written in honor of Drusus and Tiberius (4, 14)
might appear in it. If se, he collected a few written since, and some rha s
before, the ublication of the three books, among which was thie. e te le
us (v, 6) 1 at he was about fifty, which age he attained loth December,
11. c. 15. He professes to deprecate the attacks of Love, now that hc is old.
The Ode is not unlike one he wrote when he was much younger (i. 19), and
it is probable both are imitatione from the Greek.

ARGUMENT. -· Art thou at war with me again, Venus ’.ἱ Spare me, for 1
am old. Go 10 1116 young. Go to Paullus, for he is noble, handsome, elever.

25. repensus] This word is not used in this sense of ‘ redeemed ’ elsewhere)
On ‘ scilicet,' see C. ii. 14. 9.

26. Ρίαςίιὶο additis Damnum e] Horace says, ‘Ye are adding mischief to
disgraee ’; and from what follows it would seem that the mischief would
arise from having among them again those who had sunk so low. The dis-
graee had already been incurred‚ iu the surrender of the Roman troops,

27. neque amissos] See C. i. 6. 5, ιι., as to this way of speaking.

28. suoo‚] See Epp. i. 10. 27, ιι.

30. reponi deterioribus] This has sometimes been translated as if Horace
meant that true virtue would not suffer itself to be replaced by false, or virtue-
of a lower sort. I rather think he means that true virtue, when it has once
been lost, does not care to be restored to the degenerata. Horace does not
seem to consider that he is making Regulus s eak bitter things against him-
self. 'rho ument of Regulus is not πνοι-εὗ> much, aud is an invention of
Horace’s. Τ ere is an opposite statement in Virgil (Aen. ii. 367) :—

“ Quondam etiam victis redit in praecordia virtus.’'

37. Hic unde vitam] ‘He (ι’. e. the coward), not eonsidering to what ho

42. eligitis minor] A Roman citizen taken prisoner by the enemy lost his
status or civil rightS, and he who had done so was said to be ‘capite minu-
tus ’ or ‘ deminutuS,' or ‘ eapitis minor.' Livy says the Romans always
wanted compassion for their own soldiers taken in war (xxii. 61).

53. Quam si, etc.] As if he had been settling a disputo, as ‘ patroni’
were wont to do for their ‘ clienteS,' and was going to his country-seat at
Venafrum or Tarentum; respecting which places, see C. ii. 6. 11, 15. ‘ Cli-
entes ' were fiee persons under the protection osrich and noble citizens, who
in their relation to their ‘ clientes ' were called ⁶ patroni) See C. ιιι. 1. 10, ιι.

ODE VI.

As the former Odes are addressed more to qualities of oung men, this
refers more especially to the vices of young women, and so Iforace discharges
the promise with which this series of Odes begins. The state of female mor-
als at the time Horace wrote was probably not so bad as it became shortly
afterwards, though his picture is dark enough.

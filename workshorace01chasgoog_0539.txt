of art, its flelds and vineyards aud climate, all conm'buted to make it the
most conspicuous island in the AEgean.

2. concinna Samos‚] Samos (the island) is rough, but the town is meant,
and it is called ‘concinna' from its buildings, of which a temple of J uno was
one of the most conspicuous. Outside and inside, this temple was adorned
with the finest works of art. There was also a celebrated mole at SamoS,
nilade to protect the harbor, which would be au object of interest to a trav-

e er. .

2. moesi regia Soram] The town of Sardes (ul Σάρδεις), οι· the greater

part of it, which was burnt to the ground in the revolt of the Ionians, Β. c.
499, was originally built of slight materials, though it was the seat of enor-
mous wealth during the reigns of the Lydiau kin ‚ and especially that of
Croesus, whose palaea became the residence of the ersian Satraps and was
beautifled by them, especially by Cyrus the younger, whose gardens are eele-
brated (cic. de Seneet. c. 1⁷).

3. Smyrna quid et ΟοίορΙιοπ 9] Alexander the Great found Smyrna in
ruins, and conceived the desigu of rebuildiug it, being prompted by Nemesis
in a dream. He did not live to do so, but Anti nus began and Lysimachus
finished a new town on a magnificent scale. {tin-abo speaks of it as oue of
the most beautiful cities of Ionia. Among other ob‘ects of interest was a
temple erected to Homer, and called Homerium. T e inhabitants claimed
him as their countryman, and shewed a cave in which it was said he wrote
his poems.

Colophon, also-in Ionia, on the Hales, was destroyed by Lysimachus, with l
Rhodus (v. s). 1oe chief attraction was its neighborhood to tho shrine of the 1
Clarian Apollo. At present, only a few huts stand on the site cf this town. ¹

5. Attalicis α· urbibushIOne of the towns of the kingdom of Pergamum,
bequeathed by Attalus . to the Roman people, and constituted a Roman
province on the defeat of Aristonicus, 13.c. 129. The kingdom of Pergamum,
when it was handed over to the Romans, included Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, and

art of Caria, the priucipal cities of which (μητροπόλεις) were Ephesus,
germinum, Sardes, Sm rna, LampsacuS‚ Cyzicus. Other large towns were
Tralles, Adramyttium, hvatira‚ Soc„ nearly all of which are shown, by the
ruins that remain, to have been built and ornamented ou a magnificent scale.
6. Aa Lebedum laudas] Lysimachus, after the battle of Ipsus (3.0. 301),
when he became master of the western part of Asia Minor, destroyed the
towns of Lebedus and Colophon iu Ionia, and transferred their inhabitants
to Ephesus. Lebedus never seems to have been rebuilt so as to recover any
of its former importance‚ and the ruins of the old town probably helped to
cause the desolate appearance described by Horace. He writes as if he knew
Lebedus, but did not know the other places he refers to before. He must
have seen this place, if at all, in his campaigning with Brutus.
7. Gabiis deser-tior] Gabii was an ancient town of Latium, an Alban colo-
n ‚ 100 stadia from Rome. Juvenal mentions it as a place of resort for
le in humble circumstances, and calls it “ Sim lieibus Gabiis ’ἒ ” (ἱίἰ. 190).
n Horace's time, while cold bathing was'the asbion under the advice of
Antonius Musa, it a pears Gabii was resorted to. Horace may have been
there himself. See pp. 15. 9.

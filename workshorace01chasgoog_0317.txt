ODE XIV.

Wno Postumus was, or whether it is a real name, is uncertain. The sub-
ject of the Ode is the certainty of death, and it ends with a hint upon the folly

of boarding.

&cunnum—Time is slipping away, Postumus, and piety will not re·
tard the approach of or death. No sacrifices will propitiato Pluto, who
keeps even the giants ryon and Tityos beyond that stream which all must
crosS, even thou h we expose not ourselves to the dangers of war, the sea,
and climate. T ou must leave home, wife, and all thou hast, and thine heir

will squander what thou hast boarded.

1. suyaces] ‘fleeting.'

4. indomitae] The Greek ἀδάμαστος.

5. trecenis quotquot eunt dies] ‘ three hundred every day!

6. illacrimabilem] Here this word is used in an active sense. It is used
pagsiggly ¹3 C. ir. 92‘23: “ Omnes illacrigipbiles urgepfiurl’„ {eelz-{35³ on C.
1. . . om arc rcus—non exora 1 is auro . 11. . .

7. ter ampliavit] ‘ Ter' expresses the triple form of 111ὶὲ> monster, “forma
tricorporis umbrae '' (Aen. vi. 289). Η6 was a mythical king of the island
Erytheia (Gades), slain by Hercules (C. iii. 14. 1 j. Tityos was a giant who,
for attempting to violate the goddess Artemi3‚ was killed by Apollo and cast
into Tartarus, where vultures devourcd his liver (C. iii. 4. 77 ; iv. 6. 2).

8. tn'sti Compescit nnda,] This is Virgil's description (Aen. vi. 438),—

“ Tristique palus inamabilis unda
Alligatnt novies Styx interfusa coercet‚'' -
which is repeated from Georg. ir. 479. Sophocles (Electra, 137) calls it
πάγκοινον λίμναν.

9. scilicet} This is in reality a verb, ‘you may know,' ‘ you may be sure.’
It is used as an adverb, ‘assuredly,’ sometimes in a serious sense (as here),
sometimes in an ironical.

.10. Quicunque terrae munere mximum] This expresses the words of Homer, ⁴,

δῖ θνητός τ εἴη καὶ ἔδοι Δημήτερος ἀκτήν (Il. xiii. 322), οἳ ἀρούρης· καρπὸν
ἕ ovo-t Il. vi. 142 .
ll. rgyes] Thig is Horace's usual word for the rich, as observed on C. i.
4. 14. ⁴ Colonus' was the lessee of a farm, the owner of which was called
‘dominus ' in respect to that property. ⁴ Reges‚' therefore, are ‘ domini.'
A ‘colonus' might be rich and the tenant of a large farm ; but Horace re·
fers to the poor-er sort here and in C. i. 35. 6. ⁸ Inops ' he uses sometimes in
an extreme, sometimes in a qualified sense of want, but more generally the
latter, as he does ‘ pauper,' C. i. 1. 18, n. The opposition is between
high and low, and the difference is one of position, as iu the third Ode of
this book (v. 21, sqq.). ‘⁸ The small and great are there, and the servant
is free from his master.” (Job iii. 19.) This seems to express Horace’s
m‘ffiulgrustra per auctumnos nocentem] See S. ii. 6. 18, n. With ‘ nocentem '
connect ‘ Corporibus.²

18. Cocytos] This was the name of a tributary of ,1116 river Acheron in
Thesprotia, a part of Epirus. For some reason, these rivers came to be placed
in TartaruS, and the Styx was added to them as a third. The language of
the text expresses very well the character an infernal stream might be ex·

ected to wear.

p Danai yenus] ‘the family (or children) of Danaus) The punishment of
the fifty daughters of Danaus is referred to in C. iii. 11.

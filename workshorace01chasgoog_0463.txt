whether for its odor, its skrssking, or its sting. So that δήγματα κορέων,
λαθρόδακναι κόρεες, seem to have been proverbial expressions for calumny.

79. Demetrius, See above on v. 18; and as to Fannius, see S. 4. 21, n.
On Plotius, see . 5. 40; and on Valgius, C. ii. 9, Int. He was consul in
B. c. 13. Who Octavius waS, we cannot tell. Horace does not mean Augus-
tus, for, after the death of the dictator, Octavius became C. Julius Caesar
OctavianuS, and could not at this time be called Octavius. On Fuscus (to
whom the epithet ‘optimus’ belongs), see C. i. 22, Int., and S. 9. 61, and
E . i. 10.

Ρδὲὶ. Viscorum laudet uterque J] If Viscus be the correct reading in S. 9. 22,
and S. ii. ξ. 20, the persons there mentioned may be one or other or both of
these brot ers.

84. Ambitione releyata] ‘ Dismissing flattery.'

85. tuo cum fratre,1 This may have been Gellius Poplicola, Messalla's
brother by adoption. He was with Brutus and Cassius in Asia Minor3 but
left them before the battle of Philippi, and joined Μ. AntoniuS, and com-
manded the right wing of his army at Actium. If therefore this be the per·
son Horace alludes to, his acquaintance with him began in Brutus’s camp.
He was consul in the year Β. c. 36.

86. Vos, Bibule et Servi,] This Bibulus was probably the youngest son of
M. Calpurnius Bibulus, who was consul in Β. c. 59, and of his wife Porcia,
who afterwards married M. BrutuS. He wrote an account of his stepfather’s
life, which Plutarch made use of. He must have been still quite youn‘ .

Servius Sulpicius Rufus was a distinguished lawyer and friend of icero,
and he left a son named Servius, This son is perhaps the person Horace
refers to. Cicero was very fond of him, to judge by his letters to his father.
He must have been older than Horace, and very much older than Bibulus.

Furnius was also the son of a friend and correspondent of Cicero, and was
a favorite with Augustus. The e ithet ‘ candidus ' applied to him by Horace
shows that he deserved esteem. hortly after the battle of Actium he got
Augustus to take his father, who had followed M. AntoniuS, into favor.

88. Prudens] ‘Designedly,' ‘on purpose!

91. Discipularum inter jubeo plorare cathedras] Their pupils were chiefly
‘ mimae,' actresseS‚ but some ladies of birth at this time learnt singing of pro-
fessore, and it was not counted much to their praise. ‘J ubeo plorare ' corre-

sponds to the Greek οἰμώζειν κελεύω, but ‘ plorare' representS, not only the
above proverbial expression, but the drawling of the singing-master teaching
his pu ils sentimental or melancholy songS. ‘cathedra’ was an easy-cheir
uszgcljeggerlzyi wgrxssssors did not write themselves, but had slaves, called
‘ pueri a studies-or generall ‘ librarii,’ to whom they dictated. See S. 4. 19.

go before he forgot it and add it to the Satire as his ‘subscriptio ’ς which in
letters was the word ‘ vale‚' or something civil of that sort. ·

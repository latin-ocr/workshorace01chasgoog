nothing but disaster, and the greater part of the force perished. But Iccius
survived, and we find-Horace writing ιο him a few years later as A ‘ppa's
steward in Sicily (E p. i. 12). Beyond this, nothing is known ο Iccius.
The Ode is a piece o ·good·tempered, jocular irony, of which the point lies
in the man ot books going forth as a conqueror ιο subdue fierc'e natione,
untamed before, and to return laden with the spoils of the East. Later
times have seen young and chivalrous men hastening to an El Dorado in·‘*·····--

wealth, and prepare chains for the rinccs of Sabaea and the fierce Mede ’.ἱ
Which of the fair barbariaus dost ou mean to bring horne for thy bed, or
what royal page for thy table ’ἑ Sure, rivers shall flow back to their moun-
tains, and the Tiber turn again, if Iccius can desert his books to put on the

breastplate.

l. nunc] This word expresses surprise: ‘ what now, to belie all expecta-

tious, and abandon all your pursuits '
3. Sabaeae] The Romans had possession of parts of Arabia Petraea, but

not of Arabia Felix. Hence Horace sayS‚ ‘⁴ Intactis opulentior Thesauris
Arabum ” (C. iii. 24. 1). It may have been reported that the army would
proceed against the Parthiam, aster the Arabs wene conquered‚ or, as is
more probable, the ‘ horrible Mede ' is only introduced to heighten the
color-ing of the picture in a jocular wa .

5. Quae — viryinum — barbara] Χ very uncommon construction for
‘ quae virgo barbara' or ‘ quae virginum barbararum! There is humor in
the question, as if Iccius had only ιο choose for himself some royal damsel,
whose betrothed he was to slay with his own haud, and au Eastern page of

‘ ab argento potori0,’ ‘ ad argentum potorium,' ‘ a potione,' and so forth.

9. saqittas tendere] For ⁶ arcum tendere! Virgil also says (Aen. ix.
606), “ ⁸¹g⁰¹¹2¹2⁸ tendere cornu,’' and (Aen. v. 508) “pariterque oculos telum-

from Euripides (Med. 410) : ἅνω ποταμῶν ἱερῶν χωροῦσι παγαί.

doctrines of the Stoice, but seems to have qualificd them with opinions de-

and the coun viflages, and fought for the amusement of the inhabimntS,'

speaking. Horace says, What goxer who goes about the country towns ex-
hibiting, would despise the Olympio prims, if he had a hope, still more a
promise, that he should be crowned without a struggle ’ἐ By this he means,
men strive after happiness in the shape of riches‚ διο. ; but if they will learn
wisdom, that shall give them all they ean desire, without trouble or pain.
The world may judge otherwise, he proceeds to say, and make wealth the
standard of worth; but the world is not to bc listened t0‚—it is foolish

and inconsistent. ‘ Sine pulvere ’ neems to be taken from the Greek ἀκονιτί,
and means without a strug le.

in teaching‚ it enforces. orace breaks out into the praises of virtue, and
says, that, as gold is more precious than silver, virtue is more precious than
gold3 whereas, from oue end of the Forum to the other, the opposite doctrine
is insisted upon, and old and young ff there to learn it, as boys go to school,
and repeat it as schoolboys repeat eir tasks dictated to them by the mas-

58. Sed qttadrinyentis sex septem] ‘ Suppose you laek six or seven thousand
out of 400,000 sesterces (which make an equestrian property), whatever your
gertine, character, eloquence, and uprightness may he, you are ut down for
one of the common sort, and will not be allowed, under Otho’s avv, to sit in
the frent rows.' (See Epod. iv. 15, n.) ‘Plebs' is not used in its regular
sense, but contemptuously, ‘a common fellow! The equestrian order eon-
sisted of all citizens who had the above income and were not senators; for
when a man became a senator. he ccased to be an ‘e nes!

such ganne must have 'been in use among the Roman boys, and their king-
making had become a proverb. The world may despise you, he sayS, be-
cause you are poor, but, according to the boys’ rule, which makes the best
man king, you shall be a king if you do well. As to ‘ murus aeneus,’ see
C. iii. 3. 65, n. For the different senses in which Horace uses ‘nenia,' see
Epod. xvii. 29, n. Herc it significs a sort of song of triumph.

64. Ee maribus Curiis et dmntata Camillis ἓ] On this plural, see S. i. 7. 8.
The persons referred to are M. Curius DentatuS, the conqueror of PyrrhuS,
and M. Furius CamilluS, the man who saved Rome from the Gauls. The
contempt of money displayed by Curius is especially related by Cicero (De
Senect. e. 16), in terms which account for Horace's selecting him for an illus-
tration here. The boys’ strain was ever in the mouths of these noble sol-

‹liers‚ giving honor to none but the worthy. ‘Mares' is used in this sense ,

in A. P. 402. We use ‘ masculine ' in the same way. ,

67 . lacrimosa poemata Pupi,l Pupius appears to have been a writer of
trag-adies, which Horace says were pathetic, but he says it with some eon-
tempt. We know nothing more of him than this. ‘Lacrimosa’ is used
ironically. As to ‘responsare,’ see S. ii. 7. 85. ‘Praesens’ means stands
by you and urges you on, and teacbes you to meet the insults of fortune
with an independent heart and ereet bearing. ‘Aptat’ is explained by
“pectus praeceptis format amicis'' (Epp. ii. 1. 128), which province be·
longe, Horace says, to the poet.

71. Non ut porticibus sic judiciis] As to ‘porticus,' see S. i. 4. 134. He
has said that the world are not fit guideS, and he goes on to prove this by the
inconsisteucies of men, both rich and poor (71 ·- 93). He says, if people ask

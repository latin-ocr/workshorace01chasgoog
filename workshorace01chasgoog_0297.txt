ODE xxxvl.

Wno Numida was, we have no means of knowing. 'that he was an inti-
mate friend of Eoraoe's a pears from this Ode. He was also a great friend
of Lamias( C. 26 of book). He ap to have lately returned from
the army in pain, and Horace writes this de for the occasion, ealling upon
Numida’s friends to celebrate his return with saerifloe, music, and wine.

Αιιοσιιιιιιτ. - Let us sacrifice to the guardian gods of Numida, on his safe
return from Spain3 he is come to embraoe his dem· friends, but none more

. heartily than Lamia, in remembranee of their early days. Mark the fair day
with a white mark: bring out the wine without stint; cease not the danee;
let Bassus out-drink Damalis the drunken3 brin the rose, the parsley, the
113, for {lut Ἥ. Though all eyes shall languish or Damalis, she will cleave
o y to unu ,

4. Respa-ia] In the year ιι. c. 26, Augustus went into Spain to put down
an insurrection of the Cantabri. He returned to Rome two years afterwards,
and Numida returned with him, or„ perhaps a little before, sinee Augustus was
detained by siekness C. iii. 14).

7. Lamiae,] See troduetion.

8. Actae non alio reye puertiae] ‘ Rege ’ ma perhaps be put in a familiar
gaz* til’pr their· seh-oolnzasteiig if reg, it was Orb‘ ‘us Pupillus (Epp. ii. 1. 71).

puertjae] Egig1puerigae3‘ Other ,instanoes of syncope are ‘ lamnae,' ‘ sur-
pugrafflumsurpxoezfmffilggaal calgi} νῖῗιῖο of the same age, and therefore had
taken the ‘ toga. virilis' together. Epod. v. 7, ιι.

10. Cressa ne eareat pukhra dies ποίῳ] The custom of marking fair days
with a white stone or mark, and unlucky ones with a black, had passed, if not
into-practice, into a proverb with the Romans. Hence Persius (ii. 1, sqq.),

· writmg to his friend on his birffiday, says :

“ Hune, Macrine, diem numera meliore lapillo,
Qui tibi labentes apponit candidus annos.”
‘ (Jressa' is the adjective formed from ⁶ ereta,' ehalk, so called as coming from
cffiolffisssnffimmlanff nffffioeltsst there be no measured use of the wine-jar
briffhztvffltbaem in Saliqml ‘ Sanum ³ is an annotivo like τ Sanatis ’ in tho
next Ode. It occurs agam ιιι C. iv. 1. 28, where see note.

13. multi Damalis meri] ‘ Damam-1, great drinker as she is).’ Such is tho
expression ⁶ Multi Lydia nominis ’ (C. iii. 9. 7). vid (Met. xiv. 252) has
nearly the same words: “ Eurylocumque simul, multique Elpenora vini.’'
Who Bassus was, we cannot tell, without knowing more of his friend Numida.
Damalis may be anybody, — a woman like Lyde (C. ii. ll. 22), brought into
the Ode to make up a scene. The name was common among freedwomen.

14. Threicia vincat amystide,] ¹ Amystis ' was a. deep draught, taken with-
out drawing bneath or elosin the lips (ἀ, μύειν). For Threicia see i. 27. 2.

17. putres Deponent oculo-§ff ‘ will fix their languishing eyes.’ The Greeks
expressed ‘ putres ³ by τηκόμενοι.

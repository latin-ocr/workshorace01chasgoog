SATIRE IV.

Han again Horace is at pains to defend himself from the charge of malev-

olence. This ch no doubt, was loudly brought against him by those
'who were or thoug t themselves the objects of his satine3 and he attributes

to the terseness and accuracy of his own. ifle ob‘ect is to contrast his own
style and pretensions with those of Lucilius and o the Cris innses and Fan-
niuses of the day, as well as to quiet the apprehensione o his friends, and
disarm the malignity of his enemies. Everybody must admire the way in
which he takes occasion, from the necessity of sels-defeuce, to pay a tribute of
grateful affection to his father’s memory; and it would be difficnlt to find a
more pleasing picture of paternal solicitude and sound sense, as applied to a.
boy's education, than Horace has drawn in the 'latter part of this Satire.

1. Eupolis atquo Oratim& Aristophanesque] He begins by describing the
character of Lucilius as a satirist‚ and says he followed in the steps of the old
Greek eomedians. The Greek comedy was divided by the Alexandr-ine

ὃ. hinc omnis pendet Lucilium] ‘Hinc' means ‘u n them,' as ‘unde' is
elsewhere used with reference to rsons. What rffi-aoe says of Lucilius is
briefly this: that his whole strengt was laid out on the satirizing of vice in
the persons of living characters 3 that he especiall imitaoed herein the writers
of the Old Comedy‚ only chauging their metre ; t at he was funny (‘facetus ’)
and acute (⁸ emunctae naris ’), but harsh in his style of versification ; wordy
and sometimes vu ar, in consequence of the haste with which he wrote and
his impatience of e trouble o correcting. He adds below (S. 10. 3), that

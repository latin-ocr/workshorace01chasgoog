‘'audit'’ with ‘ norrvocatus! '‘Functum laboribus) ‘ when he has finished
his labors: is derived from the Greek κεκμηκότα.

ODE XIX.

'rme Ode was perhaps composed at the time of the Liberalia, like the
third elegy of the fifth book of Ovid's Tristia. The soene is laid in the
woodS, and the poet is supposed to come suddenly upon the party, consisting
of BacchuS, with his attendant nymphs and the wild creatur-es of the woods,
all attending with admiration to the as he sings his own achievementS.
'I'he poet is smitten with terror, whie gives place (v. 9) to the inspiration
of the divinity, in virtue of which he breaks out into echoes of all he had

Auentinum—Among the far hius I saw Bacchus—O wonderful!—
reciting, and the N ymphs learning, and the Satyrs all attention. Awe is

the Thracian nymphs; how thou hurledst the giant from heaven, and how

l . Bacchum] The leg-ends and attributes of Bacchus contained in this Ode
are entirely of Greek origin. The Romans had no independent notions of
this divinity, whose name Βάκχος, ‘ the shouoer,' is p'roperly no‘ more than an
adjunct of Διόνυσος.

2. docentem — discentes These correspond to the terms διδάσκειν and
μανθάνειν, as applied to t e choragus who trained, and the chorus who learnt

their parts in the Greek plssys
3. Nymphasque] The aiades and Dryades (see C. iii. 25.14). These

nymphs were the narses of Bacchus in his msancy, and ate always represented
as his eom anions.

4. Caprgaednm Satyrorum] The Satyrs are usually confounded with the
Fauns, Faunus again being confounded with Pan, who was represented with
goat's feet like the Satyrs. Lucian describes the Satyrs as being ὀξεῖς τὰ
ὦτα, hut only describes Pan as having the lower extremities like a goat, τὰ
κάτω αἰγὶ ἐοικώς. Itis vain, therefore, trying to traco any consistency in the

'poet's conceptions of these uncouth divinities.

well as the rmission of the god is given. C. i. 11. 1, n. ·

10.’ Iactis÷mellass The same attribute that made Dionysus the god of
wine also gave him milk and honey as his types. He represented the exu-
berant-e of nature, and was therein closely connected with Demeter. Any
traveller in the East can tell of honeynombs on the trees as euriously wrought
as any in gurdon-hivae. Vin-gil says (Ee. iv. 30): “Et durae quercus suda.
bunt roseida mella.”

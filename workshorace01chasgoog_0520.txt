23. Sirenum voces] How by the directions of Circe 'Ulysses eluded the'
charming voice of the Sirens, is related ‚in the twelfth book of the Odyssey,
165, sqq. ; and the way in which Circe poisoned his companions and changed
them into swine, 'will be found in the tenth book, 230, sqq. The Sirens were
QAEIPWEElthoeuswuh Ἐιῗηῗιὲΐιθῐὲεὴὲε gpli‘elsssion is not uncommon in the Greek
dramatists. It means a mere undistinguished heap, and ‘fruges consumere

nati’ is an adaptation of Homer's οἳ ἆρὸὖρης καρπὸν ἔδουσι (11. vi. 142).
‘ Nos ' means the common sort of men, among whom Horace places himself,
and all but the sage, who is like Ulyssea while the rest are no better than his ..
wife's suitors, gluttonS, wine-drinkers, and lazy; or the subjects of Alcinous,
king of Phaeacia or Scheria (an island of which, if it had any existence, the
position is unknown), the host of UlysseS‚ to whom he relates his·adventures
(odyss, lib. ix. sqq.). The king describes his people thus:

αἶεὶ δ’ ἡμῖν δαίς τε φίλη, κίθαρίς τε, χοροί τε,

εἵματά τ’ ἐξημοιβὰ, λοετρά τε θερμὰ, καὶ ctigali-

. ss· viii. 248.

The Phaeacians were proverbial in respect to good livin‹g. ySee Epp. i. )15.'
24. On ‘cute curanda,' see S. ii. 5. 38, n. -

31. cessatum ducere aarum] ‘ Duco,' as'a verb of motion, takes the accusa·

tive of the verbal substantive to denote the object, just as ‘ venio ’ and ‘ mitto '
do, “ The accusative of the verbal in ‘ tu ’ is often called the supine active,
and the ablative of the same the supine passive3 but there is nothing passive
in the latter, and therefore the distinction is inappropriate.” ‘Factu ' is ‘in
the doin ,' as ‘factum ’ is ‘ to the doing' ς so neither is passive. ι
32. ζβε juquleut homines] From the above examples of virtue, especially
Ulysses, Horace urges his friend to the pursuit of it, and asks whether, if the
robber can rise before daylight to take away other men's liveS, he will not
wake u to save his own (32—43). i
34. ἰ noles sanus curres hydropicus ‚·] It appears that active exercise was
recommended by the ancient physicians for dropsical patients, Horace
meam, that, if he will not leam wisdom while he is unharmed by the world,
he will have to do so when it has spoilt him. ῃ
39. in annum 2] So he says below (Epp. 11. 23), “neu dulcia differ in
annum.'' It is the habit of procrastinators to put off the work of to-da till
to-morrow‚ of this week till next week‚ of this year till next year, and t is is
Horace’s meaning. ‘ In annum ' is till next year. ‘ Dimidium facti qui ,
coepit habet ' is an adaptation of the Greek saying ἀρχὴ δέ τοι ἥμισυ mxv-j
τός, attributed variously to Hesiod and Pythagoras. ¹

44. Quaeritur amentum] This is advauced as a reason why men put off
the day of reformatiou‚ that they are anxious to make themselves comfortable
and rich 44 - 54 . ι’

47. No(n domu} et fundus,] See S. ii. 5. 108, n. ‘Deduxit‚’ in the next
line, is’ used like the aorist. ᾗ

52. meenta podagram] As to ‘fomenta ’ in a derived sense, see Epod. xi.
17, n. Horace means to say, that fomentatione go a small way towards cur-
iug the gout. Perhaps he means that they aggravate the pain.

55. Sperne voluptate-z] This is part of the same subject. The pursuit of
sensual pleasure is connected with the pursuit of money, which is wanted for
it. The pursuit of money leads on to envy, and envy to wrath, so that all
these pithy sayings hang together.

58. Invidia Sicula] Horace probably alludes to the bull of PhalariS, ty-
rant of Agrigentum in Sicily. It was made of bronze. Perseus were put
insido, and the metal was gradually heated till they were masted to death.
But the tyrants of Sicily were proverbial. · ἢ ² .

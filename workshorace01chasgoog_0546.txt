place of Parmenides and Zeno, was a town os Lucania, near the mouth of
the river Heles or Elees (Alento). Salernum in Campania was situatcd at
the head of the bay of Paestum, now the galf of Salerno, on the heights
above the modern town, which is close to the sea. These places were not

ῃέἕὲαξιίἱε θέαέ οὸῗιῗειξῐῖἓῐη was situatcd on a very good road, the Via
Aquilia, of which there was a branch from Picenum as far as Paestum.
Thence to Velia, about twenty mileS, there was no Roman road.

Baius] The atmosphere of Baiae appears to have been clear, and tlio
place atti-active. (Horace calls it ‘liquidae,’ C. iii. 4. 24, and ‘amoenae,'
Epp. i. 1. 83.) This made it the most favorite resort of wealthy Romans.
To invalids there was the additional attraction of hot sulphurous springS.
Horace had been in the habit of going to Baiae, as we may infer from his
connecting it with the Sabine hills, Praeneste, and Tibur, in C. iii. 43 but it

no good. As to the form of the word, see C. ii. 20. 24.

3. Musa—Antonius} This physician was a fieedman of Augustus, and
came into notice chiefly through curing him of a bad illness he contu-acted in
the Cantabrian expedition. Having found cold bathing successful with the

without reluctance‚ as it would seem from this Epistle. The death of Mar-
cellus may have contributed to making Baiae unpopular for a time, but it
soon recovered its character (see above, Epp. l. 83). There are some frag-
ments of medical works by Musa still extant, and hc is frequently referred to
as an authority by Galen. The order of the names is invented, as in C. ii.

et’tamen illis Mfizcit invisum] The sentence is this: “Antonius Musa
makes out that Baiae is useless for me, and yct he makes Baias hate me, be-
cause 1 am drenching myself with c'old water in the middle of winter.”
Horace goes on to say that the town is ang-ry with all the patients for de-
sertin it.

5. ne murteta relinqui] ‘ Mul-teta ' means groves in which houses were
ereeted over sulphur springs for vapor baths.

8. Qui eaput et stomachum] A douche bath on the head or stomach would
now be thought a strong remedy even by hydropathists 3 but it is one of
those which ancient ph sicians recommended.

9. Clusinis Gabiosque Clusium (Chiusi) ‘was one of the chief towns of
Etruria, the capital of Porsenna, and the place where the Gauls received that
insuit which led to their siege of Rome (Liv. v. 33). It was situatcd on the
Via Cassia, about one hundred miles north of Rome. Strabo (v. 3) men· “

tions several eold streams at this place, called τὰ ”Αλβουλα, which were use-
ful in many complaints both for bathing and drinking.

10. deversoria] See S. i. 5. 2, n. There was a branch of the Via Appia
at Sinuessa, leading to Cumae, called the Via Domitiana; but that, as the
name shows, was not constructed at this time, and probably the traveller
would have to continue along the Via Appia till he came to Capua, from
whence the Via Campana went to Cumae to the right, and the Via Aquilia
went straight on to Salernum, and the Appia branched off through Caudium
to Beneventum. (See S. i. 5. 50. 71.) This explains ‘laeva habena! The
horse would turn to the right as usual to go to Cumae (whence the road was
continued to the Luerine Lake and to Bauli and Baiae, about four or five
miles from Cumae).

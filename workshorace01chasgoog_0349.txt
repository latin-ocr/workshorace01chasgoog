ODE XV.

Tms Ode combines with the lyric something of the spirit of the EpodeS.
It professes to address an old woman, Chloris», telling her it is time to put an
end to her intrigues‚ for she is poor and ready to drop into her grave.

mesanum—Pu a stop to thy intrigues, for thou art old and poor.
What becometh thy daughter becometh not thee, Chloris. She may go and
besiege the young men's doors: she is in love, and cannot help it. But do
thou go spin3 music and fiowers and wine are not for thee.

1. pauperis He means to say that a poor man's wife should be thrifty and
mind her wor , especially if she be old.

6. Et stellis nebulam] ⁴ To spread a cloud over those fair stars.' An old
woman in a company of girls would be like a cloud in a sta sky.

10. tympano] The ‘ tympanum ' was a tambourine, play in all respecta
as ngw³·ml¹g ιξιιαΠγ by women, who danced as they beat lt. As to Thyias,
see . u. . .

13. Te laniae] See Argument.

14. Laoeriami‘] This was a town of Apulia, now called Lucem, in the
neighborhood o which was one of the largest tracta of public pasture-land.

ODE XVI.

Holmon here dwells on his favorite theme,—contentment and modera-
tion, —which heis able to illustrate by the example of Moeeenas (v. 20), as
well as his own. The mischievous mfluence o gold is illustrated by the
stories of Danae and others, and Horace describes his own contentment with
his humble but independent condition.

Ausonum—A stout prison and savage watchziogs might have kept
Danae from harm; but Jove and Venus smiled‚ for the knew that the god
need but change himself to gold, and the way would clear before him.
Gold penetrates through guards; gold shall burst rocks3 thereby fell 'the
house of Amphiaraus3 thereby the Macedonian won cities; thereby stem
admirals are ensnared. And as it grows, the desire for more grows too.
A high estate Ι dread. MaecenaS, thou good knight‚ the more a man denies
himself, the more the gods will give him. Ι ssy from the rich to the con-
tented, and am more independent than any r rich man in the world. My
stream, and my little wood, and my trusty ffi, are a happier portion than
all Africa. 1 have no honcy of Calabria, nor wine of Formiae, nor Gauiish
fleeee‚ yet poverty doth not pineh me ς and if Ι wanted more, thou art ready
to ive lt.

{gay small income will go further by the restricting of my wantS, than if 1

had all Lydia and Phrygia for my own. Who ask much, lack much. It

is well with him who has enough.

1. Inclusam Danaen] Acrisius, king of Argos, being informed by an oraclo
that his daughter Danae would bear a son who would kill him, shut her
up. But Jupiter found his way to her in a shower of gold, and she became
the mother of PerseuS, wh0‚ as predicted, killed his grandfather. The fable
of the shower of gold has here its simplest explanation. ‘ Tristes excubiae ⁹

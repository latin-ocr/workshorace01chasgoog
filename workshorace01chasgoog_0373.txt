22. Nec sciresas est C. i. 11. 1.
saal? dial! ‘ Sed ’ is commonly used after digressions to recover the thread
o t e su 'ect.

24. revffctae] That ‘ re ¹ is added to some verbs without maten'ally chang-
ing their meaning, has been shown before (O. i. 31. 12, n.).

25. quid mens] The difference between ‘mens ’ and ‘indoles ' is, that one
refers to the head, the other to what we should call the heart, thc disposition.

28. Nerones] The father of Tiberius and Drusus was Tiberius Claudius
Nero, which was also the emperor's name. Drusus was Nero Claudius Dru-
sue. The latter was not born till three months after his mother Livia mar-
ried Au tus. ”

29. Ρὲἲνιῗεε creantur] It is more than probable that Horace had in his mind
the words of Euripides,—

ἐσθλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν ἐσθλὰ γίγνεσθαι τέκνα,

κακῶν δ’ ὅμοια τῇ φύσει τῇ τοῦ πατρός (Fr. Alcm. 7).
‘ Fortibus et bonis ' corresponds to the common Greek expression, which it is
so difficult to rende'r, καλοῖς κά αθοῖς. Those words are in the ablative case.
Horace does not refer to the sat er os these youths, who was a worthless per-
son, but generally to their family, the Claud-ia gens, among whom were many
persons of distinction. They were divided into a patrician and a plebeian

ranch. To the latter belon cd the Marcelli. See C. i. 12. 46, n.

37. Neronibus] Claudius ero, who was of the family of which 'Tiberius
and Drusus came, defeated and slew Hasdrubal, when he was coming to the
hel of his brother Hannibal, n. c. 207, on the banks of the MetauruS, a river
in e north of Italy. Hannibal had been nearly elcven years in Ital , and
had met with few reverses‚ but after his brother's defeat his cause falle , and,
though he remained four years longer in Italy, it was far awa in the moun-
tains os the south, and the Romans ceased to be harasscd by im. Horace,
therefore, is accurate here.

38. dietam-um] See A. P. 18: “Aut flumen Rhenum.” The name is
formed into an adjective in both cases.

41. adorea,] ‘ Ador ’ was a coarse grain, called by the Greeks ζειά, but the
name was applied to grain in general, and in the form ‘ adorea ’ signified the
supply of com given to soldiers after a victory, and hence was used as synon-
yussffsgiittlcls Vlcg.r{i.ltlsg.12‚ n. This is the third time this epithet is applied to
Hannibal, w om with reason the Romans held in greater respect than any
enemy they ever had, though ‘ perfidia plus quam Punica ' was freely attrib-
uted to him. ‘ Ut,' ‘ever since’ (Epod. vii. 19). ‘Taedae' is not tore-hes,

51. Sec-tamur ultro] ‘We are pushing on and pursuing those whom to
evade and to escape is our noblest triumph? There is often some difficulty
in translating ‘ultra' ‘Uls’ is an old pre sition involving the same root
as ‘ille,' and signifying ‘ on the other side o ‚' opposed to ‘ cis.² ‘ Ultro ' sig-

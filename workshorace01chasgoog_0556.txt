EPISTLE XIX..

11· would appear that Horace had imitators among those who abused him;
and if we are to understand him to mean what he says, there wem those who
took his convivial odes literally, and, coupling them with the example of the
old Greek poem, conceived that the way to write verses was to propitiato
Bacchuo and drink a great deal of wine. Or else he means that they took
to writing in the sa‘me sti-ain, all about wine and driving dull care away, and
so forth, which at second hand would be very poor staff. Such servile im-
itatore he speaks of with great disgust; and, while he exposes their shallow-
ness, he accounts for their malevolenee towards himself b the fact of his not
having sought their company or hired their applause. ἑο at the same time
elaims to have been the first to dress the lyric measures in the Latin language‚
while he defends himself for having adopted the metres of another, by point-
ing to the examples of Sap ho and AlcaeuS, and takes credit for having
avoided the virulenee of Arc ilochus‚ while he imitated his verse. This is
introduced by the way, the chief purpose of the Epistle being to show the
folly of his calumniators and the eausa of their abuse.

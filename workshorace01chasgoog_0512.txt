eheu-fieb, thr-own in without being washed, for the benefit of its saline quali,
ties3 for which addition to the sauce he gives credit to one CurtilluS, whoever
he may have been. The superiority of the ‘echinus ' to ‘ muria' (see S. ii.
4. 65, n.) is here said to consist in the fact of the former coming fresh from
the sea, and furnishing a more perfect brine.

54. aulaea] See C. iii. 29. 15, n. The host’s dissertation was brought to
a sudden close by the falling of the tapestry from the ceiling, bringing down
among the dishes an immense cloud of dust. The guests fancy the house is
coming down, but when they find the extent of the damage, they recover them-
selves (‘erigimur’). Rufus (Nasidienus) was so disturbed by this untoward
accident, that he put down his head and began to shed tearS. Nomentanus
comforts him with an apostrophe to Formae, complaining of her capriceS, the
solemn hypocrisy of which makes Varius laugh so immoderatel , that he is
obliged to staff his napkin into his mouth to check himself. alatro, who

has a sneer always ready (μυκτηρίζων, sce S. i. 6. 5), begins a long symp‘ ·
thetic and flattering speech, with which Nasidienus is highly pleased and ct --
forted under his mis-fortune. A brilliant thought suddenly stfikes him, and
he calls for his shoes and goes out, on which the guests begin to titter and to
whisper to one another, not wishing to give offence, or to speak out before the
parasites aud the slaves (54 - 78). ·

72. amsa] This was a groom or mule-driver, or otherwise connected with
the stables. Balatro intends a sneer at the establishment, the out-door slaves
being had in to wait at table and swell the number of attendants· “

77. Ee soleas poscit] See S. i. 3. 127. The sandals were taken off before
they sat down to dinner, for which therefore ‘ soleas demere, deponere,' were
common expressions, as ‘ soleas poscere ³ was for getting up. The Greeks
had the same custom and the same way of expressing themselves.

78. διήάετε secreta] In this linc an attempt seems to have been made to
oessssffyttzztss‘jffifflfx θῗιῇξξέἓῗεέἓῖἶᾶυῗιὲξέξῑὲῗᾯωέόωειωῃς e1Se
when Nasidienus comes in. As to ‘fictis rerum,’ see C. iv. 12. 19, n. ‘Ba-
latrone secundo ’ means that Balatro played δευτεραγωνιστής, who support-
ed the principal actor, but was not so prominent. (See Epp. i. 18. 14.) Ba-
latro was a wit and sarcastic. He supplied jokes and the others laughed.

86. Mazonomo] This was a large round dish, properly one from which
grain ( ’ζα) was distributed.

87. εηιϋνα yruis] Crancs became a fashionable dish with the Romam,
but not till after this time, when storks were preferred (see S. 2. 50, n.).

88. jecur ansen‘s albae] The liver of a white goose fattened on figS, the
legs of a hare served up separately, as being (according to the host) better
flavored when dressed without the loinS, blackbirds burnt in roasting, and
wood·pigeons with the hinder parte, which were most sought after, removed
(perhaps from the ignorance of the host, who thought novelty was the best
recommendation of his dishes)² — these composed the last ‘ ferculum,' brought
in as special delicacies to make up for the late catastrophe. But the officious-
ness of the host destroyed the relish of his (lishes, such as they were, and the

guests took their revenge by tasting nothing that he put before them, and
presentl taking their leave.

95. nidia afflasset] Here is this woman again, the last time we meet
with her. See Epodes iii„ v.‚ and xvii„ and S. i. 8.

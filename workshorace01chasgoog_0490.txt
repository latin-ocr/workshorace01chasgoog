17. vespa-tinus subito ts oppresserit] On ‘vespertinus,' see Epod. xvi. 513
‘ opprimere ’ is to oven-take or come upon one suddenly.

18. malum responset] ‘ Responsare is used bfieHorace several times in the
sense of resistance. See beloW, S. 7. 85: “ sponsare cupidinibus, con·
temnere honores '’ ς and Epp. i. 1. 68. ‘Malum responset’ means ‘it disa-
ειῗξ. Ὲῗιιιὶη mixto morsm-e Palam· ; ‘ Mixto ’ means mixed with water.

20. Ρωιεπειὸω optemasunyas] ‚e says the ‘ fungi' that grew in the open
meadows were more to be trusted than others, — that is, those which grew in
the shade. Truffles and different kinds of mushrooms were much eaten by
the Romans, as they are still by the Italians. of the latter there were and
are varieties. The mushroom most highly esoeemed was the boletuS,
whic was cultivated in gamem, and kept for the eating of the rich. But all
such finggi had to be chosen with great care. Even the boletus served to
carry o an em ror.

24. Avidius This may be M. Aufidius, who was remarkable as having
been the first at Rome who bred and settened peaeocks for sale, and derived
a large profit (as much as 600,ωο sesterces a year) from that trade. As to
the eom ition of ‘mulsum,' sce note on S. ii. 2. 15, n. Falernian wine,
which oraee appears to have esteemed next ιο Caecuban, is here called
‘forte,' and elsewhere ‘severum' and ‘ardens' (C. i. 27. 9; ii. 11. 19). It
wax?l a very strong spirituous wine, and required long keeping to become
me ow.

27. morabitur] This may have been a medical word for costiveness. ‘Mi-
tulus,' the limpet‚ was an inferior sort of eheu-(ish. The Greeks called it
τελλίνη οι· ξιφῦδριον. The ‘ lapathus ' is mentioned above as a purgative
(Epod. ii. 57, n.). ‘ Brevis ' refers to the size of the plant.

30. Lubrica mecentes implent] That shell-fish were best at the time of the
new moon, appears to have been tgenerally believed among the ancients.
They had many fancies respecting e influence of the moon on various ob-
jects, in which, however, modern ignorance and superstition have perhaps
sui-passed them. But in respect ιο shell-tish, modern observationis in con·
formity with that of the ancients.

32. Murice Baiano] This shell-fish‚ from which a purple dyo was obtained,
was found, it seems, in t abundance at Baiae. It would seem not to have
been as useful for the ta le as forits dye. The ‘ peloris,’ which was found in
the Lacus Lucrinus, close ιο Baiae, appears ιο haye been an insipid fish,
though Catius says it is better than the murex. The rival oyster-beds were
in the Lacus Lucrinus and at Circeii, the opposite point of the bay which is
terminated by the promontory of that name, in Latium, and the promontory
of Misenum, in Campania. Catius gives the preference to the oysters of
Circeii, which Pliny also says were unsurpassed (xxxii. 21). See note ou
E . ii. 49. The best oysters, however, were found at Brundisium on the
of δι’ coast, Whetrlmfiattlle spawn was ean-ied ιο stock the beds on the coast

molle Tarentum] The degenerate character of the Tarentinos, which gained
their city the epithets ‘ molle,' ‘imbelle ³ (Ερε. i. 7. 45), dates from the death
of Archytas, about the middle of the fourt century n. c. Among other

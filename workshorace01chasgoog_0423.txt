besides Tigellius, who was dead, it is pmbwle many living persons felt· in·
‘ured by that Satire, and perhaps by others that have not come down to us.

e may infernum the present poem, that Horace wished to clear himself
from the imputation of a censorious spirit, and so to set himself right with
Maecenas arui his friends. The connection between the two Satires is seen in
the opening of this, in which Tigellius is again introduced, and the peculiar-
ities of his character described, for no other reason, as it would seem, than to
serve as a text for the discourse that followS, ou the duty of judging others
charitably‚ as we wish to be judged ourselveS. In the course of his remarks
on this subject, Horace falls upon two of the Stoic absurdities3 one, that all
faults are alike (v, 96, sqq.), which he meets b the Epicurean absurdity that
expedieucy is the foundation cf rffihm and e other, that every wise man
(that is, every Stoic) is endowed wi all the gifts of art and fortune, from the
skill of the mechania to the power of a king. With a jest upon this folly the

'Satire closes.

4. Tiyollim] See Introduction. This person is described as a capi-icious,
inconsistent man, of whom you never could tell what he would do next.

6. ab ovo Usque ad mala] The ‘ promulsis: otherwise called ‘ gustus:
preceded the regular meal, aud consisted of things calculated to provoke the
appetite, of which a list is given in the eighth Satire of the second book, v. 8,
sq., where, however, eggs are not mentioned, but they were usual, and ‘ ab
ovo usque ad mala,' ‘ from the eaes to the dessert‚’ was a common way of
speaking. The ‘gustus ' was eateu with a draught of ‘mulsum’ (S. ii. 2.
15, n.) sometimes before they sat down, or even before they left the bath.

7. citaret, Io Bacchei] This use of ‘ citare,' ‘to shout,' is not common.
There were convivial songs among the Greeks to which they gave the name

ἷόβιικχοι. Several f ents of such sougs by Archilochus have been pre-
served. The final sylla lein ‘ Bacche’ is lengthened, and should properly
be pronounced as the singer might be supposed to pronounce it. ,

modo summa] The suings in the tetrachord, or harp with four strin ,
. which continued to be used even after the heptachord was invented (see A. .
83, n.), from which the low notes proceeded, were uppermost as the player
held it in his haud, and the notes of the voice which corresponded with these
are expressed by ‘ summa voce! For the same reason, the high notes would
be those which harmonized with the lowest of the strings. The ‘ summa
chorda' was called in Greek ὑπάτη, and the ‘ imffi' νήτη. ‘ Chordis ' is the
dative case, the literal translation being, ‘ that voice which is the lowest
(where, for the above reason, those notes are called the lowest which we
should call the highest), and that echoes to the four strings.’

11. ‚Iunonis sacra sem-et ,·] , This refers to the ‘cane horoe,' damsels who
carried the basket of sacred instruments on their hea at sacrifices. Those
of Juno are mentioned here; but the practice was observed at all sacrifices.

habebat saepe ducentos‚] Ten slaves were a very small household lbr a rich
man, and Tigellius was rich. The number of slaves in wealthy houses iu

rimitive times was small, but afterwards grew to an extraordinary num-

12. modo reyes atque ωηατ-ὤσῃ] ‘ Modo,’ as an adverb of time, signifies
‘ now,' or some time not far from the present. It is the ablative of ‘ moduS,'
‘ measure,' and ‘ modo ⁹ is ‘ within measuress and therefore its sense is con-
fined to limited quantities. Com are the use of ‘modo ' and ‘ admodum '
in Terence (Hec. iii. 5. 8): “A venis modo? Pam. Admodum.” ‘Are

ODE IX.

Tms is a drinking song for the winter, imitated from an Ode of Alcaeus.
A party is supposed to be assembled in the city, and one calls upon the
master of the feast to bring out his best wine, and make the fire burn bright,
that they may banish care and all thought for the future, since youth is the
time for innocent enjoyment.

Aneummr. —- You see how Soracte stands out with snow, and the woods
are bending with their burden, and the sharp frost hath frozen thc streamS.-
Heap logs on the fire, and draw your best Sabine wine, feast-master, and
l‘eave the rest to the gode, at whose hidding the fierce winds are still and the
woods have rest. Ask not what is to come ; enjo the present day 3 let the
dance be ours while we are young, the Campus artiuS, the promenade‚ the
nightly assignation‚ and the coy girl that loves to be caught.

1., stet] ‘stands out.' This signifies a fixed and prominent appearance.
‘ Stant lumina flamma' (Aen. vi. 300) may be rendered in the same way.
Soracte was one of the Faliscan range 'of hills, about 2200 feet high and
twenty-four miles from Rome. Itis now called Monte Tre'st0, a corruption
from ‘ San Oreste? It is seen very clearly stom the northern point of the
city. Apollo had a temple there: “ Summe deum saneti eustos Soractis
Apollo‚’' Aen. xi. 785.

4. constiterint} ‘ have ceased flowing? See Ov. Tr. v. 10. 1 : “ Ut sumus
in Ponto ter frigore constitit Ister.” ⁴ Acuto,’ as applied to cold‚ corresponds

to the ὀξεῖα χιών of Pindar, and ‘ penetrabile frigus ’ of Virgil. But Horace
also applies it to heat (Epp. i. 10. 17); “ Cum semel accepit solem furi-
bundus acutum.'’ In English, we say ‘a sharp frost,' but do not use the
same word for heat.

7. Deprome quadrimum Sabina—diota] The first of these words means
here to draw the wine from the ‘ diota ' into the crater or bowl in which it was
mixed with water. The diota (so called from its having two ha‘ndles or ears,
ὦτα) was the same as the ‘ amphora’ (so called for the same reason), ‘ testa‚'
or ‘ cadus,' which were names for the vessels of earthen-ware or glass in
which the wine was kept, as we keep it in bottle5‚ after it. was drawn from

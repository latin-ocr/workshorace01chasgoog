refers to tho mle laid down at the beginning, and taken up in v. 30:
“ Si virtus hoc una potest dare fortis omissis
Hoc age deliciis ”3
for all that follows is only recommended ironically3 and in such a way as to
hold up to contempt every mle of life but that of virtue.

 

EPISTLE vn.

01« some occasion Horace, having gone into the country for change of air
on account of his health, at the beginning of Au st, was tempted to stay

aoe's society at this time. We can only gether the tone of his letter or mes-
sage from the character of Horace’s reply3 He says he has no mind to risk
a return of lus sickness by going back during the autumn to Rome; indeed,
that he meant to be absent at some warm place on the coast through the

rather than forfeit his liberty. He illustrates his position by two stoi-ies, —
one that of the fox who got into a vessel of corn and grew so fat there that
he could not get ont again (which Horace was determined to prove was not

1. Quinque dies] This is a conventional phrase to express any short time.
It occurs in S. i. 3. 16, “quinque diebus Nil erat in loculis.’'

2. Sextilem] In B. c. 8 this month first received the name of Augustus.

5. dum ficus prima calorque] See S. ii. 6. 18, n. The ‘designator' was
the man who arranged the processioa at the funeral of any important person,
and the ‘lictores ’ were his attendants who kept order. (See S. i. 6. 43.)

8. officiosaque sedulitas] That ie, attending upon great people, and so
forth. It does not seem as if the diminutive form ‘ opella ’ had any particu-
lar force. Horace uses diminutives when it suits the measure.

10. Quodsi bruma nives Albanis] ‘Si’ is used with reference to a future
event, evc(nS it· it be) not hypothetical‚ when any action depends upon that .

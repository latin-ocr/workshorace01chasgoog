is called by the Greek writers φοινίκις. The ‘ sagum ’ was properly the
cloak worn by the common soldier on service ; but qualified as it is here by
‘ punicum‚’ ‘ purple: it can only mean the ‘ paludamentum,’ or officer's mili-
tary cloak. Horace says the enemy has changed his purple cloak for a black
one, in token of mourning and shame for his defeat. It is to be observed,
that, though M. Antonius is clearly the person up'permost in the writer’s mind,
he only uses the general expressions ‘ hostiS‚’ ‘Romanus ’ (v. 11). ‘Mutavit’
signifieS‚ as elsewhere, ‘ has taken in exchange.’

Mzsvms was an inferior poet of the day, who appears to have employed
himself in abusing his betters. He is most popularly known through Virgil’s
familiar line, ‘⁴ Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina, Maevi '³ (Ecl. iii. 90).
It appears that he went or meditated going to Grecce‚ and Horace took a dif-
ferent leave of him from that he took of his friend virgil on a like occasion
(C. i. 3). He calls him the stinking Maevius, and promises an offering to
the tempests if they will sink his ship-

Anemmnr. — Bad luck go with the stinking Maevius. Blow, ye winds-
and shatter his ship ς no friendly star peep forth in the sky: let him be driven
as the Greeks were by Pallas for the crime of Ajax. Ο how the sailors
will sweatl and thou wilt turn deadly pale, and cry like a woman, and fall
to th prayers! Let me only hear the gulls are feasting upon thy carcass,
and will offer a goat and a lamb to the stoi-ms.

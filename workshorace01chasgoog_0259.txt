15. monumenta nqis] This significa the palace of Numa adjoining the
temple of Vesta, hence called ‘ atrium regium’ (Liv. xxvi. 27), as forming
gulhind of ‘ atrium ' to the temple. Ovid (Fasti, vi. 263) thus alludes to this

din :—
g “ Hic locus exiguus, qui sustinet atria Vestae,
Tunc erat intonsi regia magna Numae.'’

1⁷. Iliae—ultorem,] Tiber is represented as taking upon himself, without
the sanction of Jove, and in consequence of Ilia’s complaints, to avenge
the death of Julius Caesar, the descendant of IuluS, her ancestor. Ilia, or
Rea Silvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus, is variously reported to
have been married to the Tiber and the Anio, because into one of those
streams she was thrown by order of Amulius. Jove may be supposed to
have disapproved the presumption of the river-god, because he had reserved
the task of ex iation for other hands and happier means· One of the chief

21.ὀι“υεε acuissesevrum] ‘ Inter se ’ or ‘ iffimedpsos· ' may be understood.
‘ Audiet acuisse ' does not mean ‘ shall hear them sharpen, but shall hear
of their having sharpened.’ Horace is not predicting what is to be, but
lamenting what has been.

1122ἰᾱίέ1ιιὶο--- perirent,] ‘ By which it were better that the hostile Parthians
s ou e.’

PersianS, Mcdes, and Parthians are names frcely interchanged by Horace.
The Parthian empne, at the time Horace wrote, extended nearly from the
Indus to the Roman province of Syria ; and the Parthians were in the habit
of making incursions into that revince, which fact is referred to in the last
stanza of this Ode. Although t e name of Augustus, assisted by their own
disputes, did something towards kee ing them in check, they were held by
the Romans to be their most formidahle enemies. Augustus meditated, but
never carried out, war with the Parthians3 and the Romans never tiu the
reign of Trajan gained any successes against them. Their empire was
broken up, and succeeded by the Persian kingdom of the Sassanidae, during
the reignfof Alexander SeveruS, Am. 226.-‘ Pei-irent' would in prose be

rituri orent.'
1³34. Rara juventus] ‘ Our children thinned by the crimes of their fathers?
It took years of peace and the enaetmcnt of stringent marriage-laws to restore
the pulation of Rome, which was thinned not only by bloodshcd, but by
indi erence to marriage and laxity of morale.

25. Quem vocet divum] Vesta was the tutelary goddess of Rome. See

Virg. Georg. i. 499, sqq. ,
“ Dii patrii Indigetes, et Romule, Vestaque mater,
Quae Tuscum Tiberim et Romana palatia servas.''
She is represented as turning a deaf ear to the prayers of her virgins, be-
cause Cgesar as Pong'fex Maximus had particular charge of her temple and
riteS. n vocet, see .

29. scelus] The guilt of the civil wars and of Coesar's death. which, as
Horace implies in what follows, was to be expiatcd by Augustus m the
chlamcter of Mercury, the messenger of peace—‘Partes' means ‘ office,'
‘ ut .’

AE'heas was said to have preserved the lire of Vesta and brought her to
Rome. ‘ Carmina’ (‘hymns ’) is opposed to ‘prece ’ as a set formula to
other rayers· ‘ Carmen ’ has that meaning in respect to legal or any other
forma documents. Liv. i. 26: ‘¹ Lex horrendi carminis.’' Epp. ii. l. 138:
“ Carmine Di superi placantur carmine Manes.'’

31. Nube candentes humeros amictus] So Homer describes him, εἱμένος
ὤμοιϊν νεφέλην (11. xv. 308). Virg. (Aen. viii. 720): “candentis lumine

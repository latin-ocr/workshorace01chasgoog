(Milan).. He was a slave, but asterwards received his fieedom. He died
B· c. 168, the year after Ennius. His contemporaries held him in high estima-‘
tion. Cicero places him at the head of the comic poets, but speaks ill of liis
Latin. What is meant by ‘ gravitate ' is as uncertain as ‘ properare ’ in the
verse before, and for the same reason.

Terentius ana] The exact sense in which Horace meant this word is
equally uncertain with the others; perhaps it has reference to the eleganco
of Terence's languagc, or the skill with which he draws real life in his playS.
There are few like him now. His name was P. Terentius Afer. He was a
slave in the family of one P. Terentius Lucanus, whose praenomen and gen-
tile name he took, on his manumission, retaining as a co omen the name
which he derived from the place of his birth, Carthage. he plays we have

60. arcto stipata theatro] The plays of Terence and all the earlier and
more celebrated poets were performed, at first, either on scaffoldings erected
in the CircuS, and afterwards taken down, or in temporary wooden theatres,
usually on a very large scale ; the notiori being that a systematic encourage-
ment of plays, by the erection of permanent buildings was injurious to ub-
lie morale. The first permanent stone theatre at Rome (for they had t em
in the country towns some time before) was built by Cn. PompeiuS, after the
Mithridatio war, outside the walle, near the Campus Martius.

62. Livi scriptoris ab aeva] T. Livius Andronicus is spoken of by Quin-
tilian as the first Roman poet. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he
died a. c. 221, or thereaboutS. He wrote a translation of the Odyssev‚ and
plays. These were all, as far as we know, ‘palliatae,’ from the
Cicero says they were not worth a second reading.

63. Interdum vulqus] The multitude, he means, are not altogether blind ·

66. dure -iynaveJ The first re resents the harshness of the style, tho
second its carelessness Compare . P. 445. ‘Jove aequo ' is the opposite
of ‘Jove non probante ' (C. i. 2. 19 .

70. plaqosum milei parvo Orbilium ictare ,·] Orbilius Pupillus was a native
of Beneventum. In his fiftieth year (Β. c. 63) he came to Rome and set up
a school. He seems to have held the rod as the principle of school govern-
ment. He lived in great poverty, in a garret, to nearly a hundred years of
age, having long lost his memory. His townspeople were proud of him,
and erected a marblo statue to his memory. Orbilius was in his forty-eighth
year when Horace was born. He was therefore not young when the poet
went to his school. As to ‘dietare,' see S. i. 10. 75, n.

73. verbum micuit] ‘ If a decent word starts up.’

75. ducit venditque poema] ‘ It brings forward and gives a value to the
whole poem.' Compare Juvenal (vii. 135): “Purpura vendit Causidicum,
vendunt ameth stina.'’

79. crocum r ue perambulet Attae Fabula] Atta was a writer of come-
dies (‘togatae')‚ o which a few fragments remain. He died Β. c. 78. It is
not clear that Horace had any particular play in mind, but it may have been
an affectation of Atta's to have flowers scattered on the stage, on which it
was usual to sprinkle a perfume extracted from the crocus. The perfume
was mixed with water and thrown up through pipes, so as to sprinkle not
only the stage, but the spectators. The most famous crocus was that of
Mount Corycus, in Cilicia (see S. ii. 4. 68, τι).

82. Quae ymnis Aesopus,] Claudius AEsopuS, the tragie actor, was an in-
timate friend of Ciceno’s, and most of the distin ished men of that time.
He was older than Cicero, though the date of his irth is not known, or that

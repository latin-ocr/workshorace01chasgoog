9. fere} This is used much as ‘prope’ is above. Horace says that- sear
and desire are much on a par, both indicating the want of that equanimity
which he commends at starting. ‘ Miratur’ expresses the astonishment of
fear, as well as of admiration, and so does ‘ stupet ’ frequently, and ‘ exterret'

agplies, like ἐκπλήσσειν, to either stato of mind. ⁶ Torpet' does the same.

( 15. Insani sapiens] whether itonically‚ or carried away by an unusual fit
of enthusiasm, Horace maintains that a man may seek virtue itself “ultra
quam satis est.” What he means, or should mean, is, that excitement is to
be avoided in the pursuit of the chief good as well as of subordinate goods.
But, by saying that virtue itself may be admired inordinately, he is able to
introduce with more contemptuous force the vulgar objects of admiration that
follow, respecting which see C. iv. 8. 2; S. i. 4. 283 ii. 3. 118; and other
places iu the Satires.

Who is meant b MutuS, if anybody, is not known ; probably no one in par- -

fore is a Roman name, is perhaps adopted here by way of oppositioni to the
eloquent man, who by his own exertions was running an unequal race with

the other man's luck.
24. Quidquid subterra est] This is like Sophocles (Aj. 646) ε

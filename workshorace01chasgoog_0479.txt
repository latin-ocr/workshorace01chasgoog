snitorsbf Penelope laugh when they would rather have cried, like “ Quin et
Ixion Tityosque vultu Risit invito ' (C. iii. 11. 21). The sense ie, that this
cunning debtor, when his creditor sues him, will put on all kinds of charac-
terS, tell all manner of lie's, get out of the obligation‚ and laugh at his *cred-
itor, let him do what hc will to bind him.

‘what you can never >recover.' ‘Dictare ’ is to dictate the form of bond for
the borrower to write out, or the sum to be entered in his own bookS, and
either way is equivalent to lending money. When the unjust steward in the
parable told his master’s debtor to sit down quickly and write less than he

Phocis ou the Sinus CorinthiacuS, and was celebrated for the productiori of

saly, another in Locris, each >of which is said to have produced hellebore, but
see note on A. P. 300. ‘Destinare ³ is a medical term for prescribing. Ster-
tinius says that he rather thinks reason would proscribe the whole produce of
Anticyra for the covetouS, whom he reckons the worst of the four.

84. Staberi This person is unknown. The exhibition of gladiatore was
originally a uneral ceremony, and so continued aster the practice became
common as a popular entertainment. After the funeral of a wealthy man a
distribution of meat to the people (‘ visceratio ³) was not unusual, und a b-
lic banquet (‘epulum ') was very common, to which persons of the ln est
distinction that the friends could get to attend were mvited. The distribu-
tion of corn (‘ frumentatio ’) was also a common practice. This Stabetius,
who considered it a dis ce for any man to die poor, willed that the amount
of his property should recorded on bis tomb; and his heredeS, if they did
, not do this, were, by a condition in his testament, ⁴ damnati,' under a penalty,
to celebrate bis funeral with gladiatorial shows and an epulum on a scale to
be determined by Arrius, which would be a costly scale. ‘Damnati ’ is a
jegal term, and penalties were common in Roman wills. We must infer from
the text that 200 pairs of gladiators were in Horace's day an extravagant
number, bnt iu later times it would not bave been excessivo.

86. arbitrio Am] Quintus Arrius (see below, v. 243) was well known in
his day. He was a man of low character and origin, and rose by timeserv·

cn ainment.

down the law for me.’ As to ‘ patruus,' see C. iii. 12. 3, and above, S. 2. 97.

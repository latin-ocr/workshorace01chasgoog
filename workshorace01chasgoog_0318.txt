ODE XV.

Wmffl Angustus had brought the civil wars to an end, B. c. 29, he applied

himself to the reformation of munnere, and Horace probably wrote this and ·

other Odes (ii. 18, iii 1-6) ιο promote the reforms of Augustus ; perhaps
by his desire, or that of Maecenas. They should be read together, and with
C. i. 2. From the reference to the temples in th'e last stanza, it may be
assumed perhaps that this Ode and the sixth of the third book were written
about the same time, that is, B. c. 28, when Augustus set himself particu-
lari to restore the public buildingS, which had fallen into neglect during the
civi wars.

Augustus passed several sumptuary laws to keep down the expensive
habits of the rich citizens, regulating in particular the eost of festivals and
banquets· But they soon fell into disuse and contempt, as Tiberim, writing
to the Senate fifty years afterwardS‚ declared ε· “Tot a majoribus refertae
leges, tot quas divus Augustus tulit, illae oblivione, hae, quod flagitiosius
est, contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere '² (Tac. Anu. iii. 54).
Horace in this Ode complains that the rich are wasting their means on fine
houses and luxurious living, contrary to the example of their forefathers,
vlvjho wgre content to live in huts while they built handsome temples for

1. Jam pauca aratro] Tiberius (see Introduction) complained to the Sen-
ate that Rome was entirely de endent on the provinces for her corn, and was
at the mercy of the winds an waves, which might at any time eut off tho
supply and reduce the citizens ιο live on their ornamental woods and country-
houses. (Compare Sall. Bell. Cat. 13.) ‘Regiae ’ is used in the same way

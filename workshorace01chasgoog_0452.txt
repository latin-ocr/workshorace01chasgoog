9. Postquam nihil inter unumque Convenit‚] W'hen they found they could
not settle their quarrel privately, they went before the praetor (v. 18). The
digression that intervenes is a comparison between such disputants and the
warriors of the Iliad. When men fall out, sa s he, they fight aster the fashion
of two brave heroes engaged in a deadly feu , even as Hector and Achilles,
who hated each other so mortally, and were so exceedingly brave, that they
could not be separated when they came together in conflict till one or other
was killed 3 or else they behave as when two cowards meet, and both are glad

11. inter Hectora -ἀέ ue inter Achillem] This repetition yof ‘inter’ is not
uncommon. See Cic. l. c. 25: “ Contio— judicare solet quid intersit
inter popularem civem, et inter constantem, severum, et gravem? See Epp.
i. 2. 11. ‘Animosum' belongs to ‘Achillem,’ ‘atque’ being often put by
{loli-{pe aster the first word of its clause. See Epod. xvii. 4. S. 1. 5. 43

15. vexet] The meeting between Glaucus and Diomed, in which the former
loses beart and gives up his arms to his adversary‚ is related in Hom. 11. vi.
234, sq . On ‘ula-of see C. iv. 4. 51, n.

18. gneio praetore tenente] Brutus was ‘ praetor urbanus ’ in the r B. ο.
44, when Caesar was killed; and in the course of the same year he eft Rome
for the purpose of taking possession, as propraetor, of the two provinces of
Macedonia and Bithynia, which had been assi ed him by the senate, who
revoked his appointment before he had reached {lis revince, and assigned it
to M. Antonius, and he made it over to his brother aius. Brutus, however,
in defiance of the senate, took possession of the province of Macedonia, and
retained it after the formation of the coalition between Augustus and M. An-

tonius. Being then at war with the senate, he led his troops into Asia Minor
⁹ as into a foreign country, and overran Lycia, and dealt with Asia as his own
province. Proceeding through the count . he probabi held ‘ conventus'
(see below, v. 22) at particular places, for t e purpose o hearing disputes as
ropraetor3 and it was at such a gathering at Clazomenae that this cause of
ersius and Rex was heard. Horace calls Brutus ‘ praetor,’ though he was
not entitled strictly to the name, particularly in res ect to the province of
Asia, which had never been assigned him. He ed himself at this time
‘ imperator‚’ as appears from coins still existin . ·¹

20. Compositum melius cum Bitho Bacchiusff ‘ compositum ' agrees with
‘ par’ understood, that word being used as a substantive for ‘ a pair,’ both in
the singular, as here, and the plural, as Cic. Lacl. c. 4: “ Ex omnibus seculis
vix tria authquattggg nolxziinantur paria amicorum.”h Bgfthushalnd Bacillilius

- 22. ridetur ab omm' Conventa ,·] ‘ Ridetur' is used im rsonally. ‘ Conven-
tus ’ was a meeting‚ at fixed times and places, of the in bitants of a province
before the praetor or governor, for the purpose of settling disputes and trans-

acting business. The name was also applied to certain districts out of which
such meetings were composed.

23. laudatque cohortem ι] The official staff of a provincial governor was
called his ‘ cohors’ and ‘comites' See Epp. i. 3. 6 ; 8. 2, 14. The lower
officials, who did not belong to the ‘ cohors‚’ t were a good deal about the
person of the governor, Cicero s eaks of as those “ qui quasi ex cohorte prae-
toris appellari solent '' (Ad Qu. r. 1. i. Ep. l. c. 4, where see Long's note).
‘ Comes ' was retained as a title of honor during the empire, and has survived
to the present da in the word ‘ count! =

able in six months (vi. 3). orace advises his man not to let himself be as
poor as this king. ‘ Hic’ is an adverb, like ἐνταῦθαε it means ‘in this po-

40. Lucullus, ut aiunt] L. Licinius Lucullus, being proconsul
in Cilicia, conducted the war against Mithridates and Tigranes, king of Ar-
menia, as related by Plutarch in his life, but being superseded in his com-
mand by Cn. Pompeius, he returned to Rome with great wealth accumulated
hy himself in Asia, which he devoted to every sort of costly sels-indulgence.
Plutarch relates this anecdote of Horace’s, with a little variation. A praetor

who wished to get up a public spectacla on an ambitione scale (φιλοτιμου-

have them. The next day he asked hix'n how many he {vantem and when
the praetor said a hundred, Lucullus hade him take twice that number.

The ‘chlam s ’ was an u per garment wem by the Greeks, a light sort of
shawl thrown oosely over the person in a variety of ways. The Romans did
not wear it till the nme of the empire, and it πω never more than an ocea-
sional gai-ment at Rome. LuculluS, it seems, had brought with him a large
number of a eostly kind from Asia, where they were wem in the Greek cities.
What the representation may have been for which the praetor wanted these
‘chiam des’ is not certain, but Greek clmracters must have been introduced.

50. Mercemur servum] There was a class of slaves called. ‘nomenclatores ’

or ‘fartores' (cr-ammom), ὀνοματολόγοι, whose office it was to accompany
their master when making, or attend him at home at the honr of ‘ salutatio ’
(when, if he was a person of consequence, people of all sorts came to pay him
their respeets), and to remind him of the names and circumstances of his
visitors, and anything else that it might be necessary for the master to re—
member. If he was aiming at any office, he had to be particularly polite to
the citizens of all classes, and his ‘ nomenclator,’ if he were elever, would be
of good service to him in this matter. Horace's advice to the man who
thinks happiness depends on such things as show and popularity (‘ species et
gratia ’) is, that he should hire a elever ‘ nomenclator-‚³ if he had not one of
his own, to go with him through the streete, and nudffie him whcnever he
came to any one of influenee, and remind him to shake ands and sa some-
thing civil to him, calling him affectionately ‘my brother,’ ‘my fat er,' ac-
cording to his age. ‘Nomenclatores ' were also employed to explain to the

51. coyat trans pondera dextram Pom'yera] ‘ Cogat’ merely expresses tho
encrgy of the nomenclator. ‘ Pondera ’ means obstructione of various kinds,
which were common in the narrow streets of Rome, 'as Horace describe8‚
Epp. ii. 2. 72, sqq„ and Juvenal (iii. 245). He was to stretch out his hand
to shake hands with the voters. Cicero (Pro Plane.) speaks of P. Scipio
Nasica, when a candidate for the aedileship, shaking hands with some rough
veter, anfi} alskiug him good-humoredly “if he walked on his handS,’' they

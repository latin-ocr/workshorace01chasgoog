“ Scipiadas duros bello.” As the elder Scipio had Ennius to praise him (see

C. iv. 8), so the younger had Lucilius, who was his intimate friend, and who

 

ser-ved under him in the Numantian war. There is no necessity sor‘ suppos- Ι

low who has no respect for himself, who lets himself out, at the priee of a
dinner, to entertain rich people and their guests with buffoonery and small
talk. Milonius, as soon as the wine got into his head, would get up and
danoe before the company, the lowest proceeding in the eyes of a Roman

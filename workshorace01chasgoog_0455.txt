440 sorus. 1

Romans walked in oold weather to get the sun, and had a full view of tho
pestilent plain which Maecenas conver-ted into a paradise. Juvenal calls it
‘ ventosus ’ (S. viii. 43). ‘ Quo' is used in the sense of ‘ ex quo!

17. Cum mihi non tantum] ‘ Cum ’ is thus connected with what goes before.
Priapus says the locality is now made healthy‚ and the citizens may take
their walk without being sickened with the sight of bones bleaching upon the
plain, whereas his vexatione still rema-in, — the driving away of thieves and
wild animale, which still frequented the spot, and, yet worse, the punishment
and scaring away of the witehes‚ who there continued to carry on their abom-
inable practices. We may suppose that, though the place was cleared, the
witches still continued, from habit, to haunt the scene of their iniquitie5‚ and
that the ‘fures ' and ‘ ferae ' are the depredators that came to rob the gardens
which were the god’s particular care. There is no other instance of ‘ suetus '
being used as a trisyllabis. . Eueretius so uses ⁴ suevit ' (vi. 854) ε “ Qui ferri

before the tombs were cleared awa (v. 36), in which the characters intro-
duced are the notorious Canidia, of whom we have seen enough in the Epodes‚

ance and behavior are much the same as there.

niqra succinctam vadere pulla] The ‘palla' was the up garment wom
by women out of doors, as the men wore the toga. (See ΕΞ. 29, n.) Here
‘succinctam ' signifies ‘expeditam‚’ ‘ swift in her movementS,' as in Epod. v.
25. ItSis equivallent to ‘praecinctis' in S. 5. 6, where see note, It occurs
a ain .ii. 6. 10 .

g25.’ Cum Sayana majore] ‘ Major-e ' probably signifies that Sagana was
older than Canidia.

27. pullam] AEneas offers a black lamb to Nox and Tem (Aen. vi. 249) :
“ Ipse atri velleris agnam Aeneas matri Eumenidum magnaeque sorori Ense

“ Et me lustravit taedis et nocte serena
Concidit ad magicos hostia pulla deos.'’
28. confusus] ‘Pourcd and stix-red? Compare Tibull. (i. 2.. 45):
“ Haec cantu finditque solum, Manesque sepulcris
Elicit, et tepido devocat ossa rogo.''

29. Manes] See Epp. ii. l. 138, n.

30. Lanea et effiyies erat, altera cerea .·] The meaning of the woollen image,

32. milibus—modia] There was scarcel any imaginable form of eru-
elty to which slaves were not liable, through e caprice of their ownem, and
this of roasting or half-masting alive may have happened to more than one
- poor wretch of this cluse.

heaven: as Artemis (b the Greeks) or Diana (b the Romans) upon carth ;
and as Proserpina in arturus. In the first and {ast of these forms she was
invoked by·witches. Here it is in her infernal character.

35· sqmlcra] These were great barrows formed by the burial of a number
of corpses >in one pit v. 8, n.).

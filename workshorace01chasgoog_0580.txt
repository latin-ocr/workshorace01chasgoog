where. What Horace here calls ¹ querimonia ’ is ἐλεγεία θρηνητικῆ, mourn-
ing for the dead. The, earliest writers of elegy were Gallinas of Ephesus,
Tyrtaeus of Attica, Archilochus of Paros, and Asius of SamoS, all in the
seventh century Β. c. It was therefore of Ionian origin, whiehever of these
poets first employed it. That question, which was not settled in Horaee’s
day, is not likely to be settled now.

most used in the dialogue of the earliest Greek trag-edice was the trochaic
tetrameter, which metre is used in many passages of the Persae of AEsehylus.·

dialogoe generally3 not those dialogues in which verse answers to verse,

noise of the theam-e, it may be that he refers to the clear intonation which
that metre admits of, or to its engaging the popular attention stom its adap-
tation to the understandings of all. ·

(‘tibia ’) came very early into use as an accompaniment to lyric poeti-y, it ·
has always retained the name it originally derived from thel re. The de-
scription of Horace includes the choral lyric of the Doric sc ool, and the
poetry of the AEolic school. 'Phe former was adapted to a choir, the latter
only to a single voice. The former was so called, because it was cultivated
by the Dorians of the Peloponnesus and Sicily3 the latter flourished among
'the AEolians of Asia Minor, and particularly in the island of Lesbos, The
one celebrated gods and heroes or renowned citizens, and was used at public
festivals or at marriages and funerals; the other expressed individual thoughts
and feelings. Aleaeus and Sappho are the chief representatives of the latter
school ς of the former, Alcman and Stesichorus, Ibyeus, SimonideS‚ Bacchy-
lides, and Pindar. Stesichorus and IbJ’cus were most celebrated for their
poems on mytholog-lesi subjecte (‘ divos puerosque deorum ’)‚ while Simon-
ides and Pindar were the greatest in ἐπινίκια, hymns in honor of the victore
at public gamos (‘ et pugilem victorem et eq‘uum certamine primum ')‚ and
the poets of wine and passion (‘ juvenum curas et libera vina ') were Aleae‘uS,
Sappho, SimonideS, and Bacchylides.. Horace does not mention one class
gelyric poems‚ the threnos or dirges for the dead, of which Simonides was

gremst· , ’ master.

104. Sa· quis emat citharas] Sir Hem-y Halford relates an instance of
lunacy which illustrates this: “ In another well-known case which justified
the Lord Chancellor’s issuing a writ ‘ de lunatico inquirendo,’ the insanity of

parting with nothing. When strongly urged to put on a clean shirt, he would
do it, but it must be over thc dirty one ; nor would 116 put off his shoes when
he went to bed. He would agree to purchase anything that was to be sold,
but 116 would not pa for it. He waS, in fact, brought up from the King's
Bench prison, where he had been committed for not paying for a picture
valued at ³6 1,5oo which he had agreed to buy; and in givin my opinion to

Compare C. ii. 4. 19 : “ Tam lucro aversam.” ‘ Istis’ (v. 108) is the dative

115. Chii veterisque Falerni] Pliny says, respecting the age of Falemian,

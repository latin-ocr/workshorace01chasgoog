lair of beasts. From Gades to the Nile let her be feared, but let her learn to
despise the gold that lies buried in the ground. Lct her stretch her arms to
the limits of the earth, to the stormy North and the fiery East, but lct her not
dare to rebuild the walls of Troy. On an evil day would she rise again:
thrice let her rise, thrice should she fall by the power of «Jove’s sister and
lspouse.” But hold, my Muse, nor bring down such themes to the sportive
yre.

1. Iustum] i. e. “ qui jus servatss’·

2. jubentium] Tlus is the techmcal word for the passing of a law by the

5. Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae] Compare C. ii. 17. 19, and i. 3. 15.
This assemblage of terrible objects is hetemgeueous enough, but the seventh
and eighth verses present a fine picture. ‘ Though the arch (of heaven) break
and fau on (him), the wreck will strike a fearless man.’ ‘ Orhis ' is used for

the sky, 8⁵ the Greek poets used κύκλος with or without οὐρανοῦ.

6. fulminantis] This is a word not used by prose—writers of Horace's day.
The same may be said of ‘triumphatis ' (v. 43).

7. illabatur] The regular construction would be with the future, as the
&ture fgllows in ‘ ferierit! ‘ lllabatur ' should. have ‘ feriant ’ in prose. See

ow . 9. 12, n. ’

9. ἅντε] ‘qualit ' or ‘ virtue!

10. Enisus] T is means struggling forward with earnestneSS, which is
the force of ‘e.’ Compare C. iv. 8. 29. Epp. ii. l. 5, sq.

12. Purpureo bibit ore nectam] See note on Epp. ii. 1. 15. The epithet
‘ purpureo ' is applied to ‘ ore ' in its sense of ‘ lips.

16. Martis equis] This appears to have been the genuine old legend of

sq. See note on Epod xvi. 13. ’

17. Gratum eluctata] See Introd.

19. incestusque] See O. 2. 30.

21. ex quo] ‘ever since.' This signifies that the fall of Troy was deter7

“ mined from the time of Laomedon's crime, and that the crime of Paris and

Helen caused its accomplishment. 'Destituo ' with an ablative is unusual.
In the Iliad (xxi. 441, sqq.) Poseidon relates how he built the walls of Troy,
while Apollo kept sheep for Laomedon, father of Priam, and how they were
cheated of their pay and dismissed with threats, when their work was done.

The same king cheated Hercules out of some horses he had promised him, ·

and he lost his life sor his pains. , J uno and Minerva had their own quar-rel
with Troy for the judgment of Paris, which gave Venus the prize of beauty ;
but Juno here makes out a different case against the city.

23. ᾱαηιηαιαηι] Agreeing with ⁴ Ilion ' (v. 18). The feminine form ‘Ilios '
occurs elsewhere (Epod. xiv. 14). ·

25. adulterae It is doubtful whether Horace meant that for the dative or
genitive case, t at is, whether it goes with ‘ splendet ' or ‘ hospes!

‘Invisum nepotem ’ was Romulus, her grandson through Mars. ‘ Troica
sacerdos ' was Rea Silvia, or Ilia, the Vestal virgin, daughter of Numitor,
and descended from AEneas.

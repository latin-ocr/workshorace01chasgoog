as a niatter of course. Other instances are numerous.

202. Ίῖὁὶα non ut nunc οι-ἰοΙιαΙω vincta] The ‘ tibia ' was 811 instrument ·
originall made of a hollow recd (Pliny, xvi. 36. 66), or a boxwood pipo
(ovid, ast. vi. 697), or the ahin-bone of some animal, from which 1110 name
is derived. Afterwards it was brought to greater perfection, and was made
of ivory sometimes, It resembled the flageolet or olarionet. It was usual to
'play two ‘ tibiae ' together, as observed on C. 1. 1. 32, where see note. Those
111 1110 British Museum have six holeS. Probably in the days of Horace they
had more. The metal which the ancients called ‘orichalcum ’ is unknown.
It was not to be found even in Pliny's time. The probable derivation is from
ὄρος and χαλκός, the meaning being ‘ mountain-bronm.' With this the parts
of the ‘ tibia‚’ which took to pisces as our flutes do, were bound at the join-
ings. Horace says that in simpler days the ⁴ tibia ' served for 811 accompani-
ment to the chorus, but afterwards it came to drown it. In those days the
population of the ci was smallcr, the theatres less crowded, and the andi-
ence more reverentia and attentive. What times Horace alludes to, it is diffi-
cult to say. Orelli thinks his history of choral music is a fanciful account,
fluctuating wonderfnlly between the practice of the Greeks, that of the Ro·
Iffim' and that which his own. imagination has drawn3 and this is perhaps
t case. · .

208. Postquam coepit cyr-os] That is, “ post Punica bella ” (see Epp. ii. 1.
162, 11.) if we take the Romans, and tho Persian war if we suppose the
Greeks to be meant (See v. 93 of the same Epistle.) As to ‘placari Ge-
nius,' see Epp. ii. 1. 144, and i. 7. 94, n. ,

211. numerisque modisque] This combination occurs above, Epp. ii. 2. 144.
‘ Liber laborum ' is a poetical construction like “operum solutis '' (C. iii. 17.
16) and “opernm vacuo ” (S. ii. 2. 119).

215. traxitque 1:091oe per pulpita vestemfl The ‘ palla ' worn by tragic
actors had 8 train called ‘ syrma,’ from συρειν, because it swept the stage.
This is what Horace alludes to. The Roman dress was probably not so
splendid as the Greek. As to ‘pulpita,' see E p. ii. l. 174.

216. Sic etiam fidibus moes crevere severia] ee above, v. 83, n. The se-
date aud serious Doric style would be expressed by ‘ fidibus severis ’; but
Horace is speaking generall , and probably from his own imagination, when
he says thatin the course ο 111110 the grave style of music to which the cho-
ruses were once sung gave way to a more vehement style, as the eloquencc
of the chorus grew more impetuouS‚ and it began to speak in language
obscure, prophetie, and oracular. There is no historical accuracy in this
account, though in respect to the obscurity of some of the Greek choruses
Horace wrote from what he knew of them. .

220. Carmine qui traqico] Horace here passes 011 10 11ιο Satyric Drama
of the Greeks. A goat was the prize contendcd for 111 1110 composition of the

choral songs or dithyrambs to which the name τ· ῳδία first belonged.
The name may have been derived from the prize. Ἕω beloW, v. 275, 11.)
The chorus appeared in the character of Satyrs as attendants on DionysuS,
at whose festival they performed. Their subjects were originally confined to
the adventur-ee, serious and sportive, of that god, and therefore were a mix-
ture of mirth and gravity. ChoeriluS, an older contemporary of AEschylus‚
seems to have laid the foundation of an independent Satyric Drama, the
entire separation of which 110ηέ 1118ξ8ῖιὶ1ἔέ88ἓΐννὲὴιιιὶᾙἱζιᾎίετειίῗζιᾱᾶἔὲἰιζοτὲ,

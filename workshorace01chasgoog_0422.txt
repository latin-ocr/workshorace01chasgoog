101. ut vivam Maenius 5'] The construction is thex same as “discinctus aut
perdam nepos '’ (Epod. i. 34), where it has been proposed to insert ‘ut' be-
ore ‘ nepos! Maenius and Nomentanus ap ear to have been squanderers of
money, and good livers, according to the o vious meaning of this passage.
They are united again in S. i. 8. ll, ii. l. 21, where the former ap ears under
the name Pantolabus‚ one who lays his hands on anything e can get

(πάντα λαβὼν), οι· borrows money from any one who will lend it. He spent
his mone and turned parasite. Both Maenius and Nomentanus are names
used by ncilius for characters of the same kind, and Horace may very prob-
ably have only bon-owed the names to represent some living characters,
whom he does not choose to point out by their own names. Nomentanus
was the name of one of the guests at the dinner of Nasidienus (S. ii. 8. 25).
He appears a ain, S. ii. 3. 224, sqq.

103. Frenti adversis componere .·] These words go together, ‘ to bring
face to face, and compare or match.' ¹

104. vappam] ‘ Vappa,’ wine which has t flat and sour, expresses a
worn-out debauchee: ‘ nebulo,' ‘a frivolous felffiw, light as a mist (⁸ nebula ’).

105. Tanain — socerumque Vitellii] The Scholiast says that Horace has
conveyed under these names a wel -known Greek proverb. What the dis-
tinction between them may have been, is unknown.

108. nemo at avarus] ‘ Ι return to that point from which I have digressed,
how that no eovetous manis satisfied with himself? The reading is not eer-
tain, and the hiatus is unusual. Horace qualifies the general assertion he
made at the ouiset, by limiting his remark to the avaricious. See note on v.
283 and on ‘laudet,' see v. 3. ·

114. Ut, quum carceribus] These lines are a little like the last three verses ·

of Virgil's first Georgic.

119. Cedat uti oonvwa satur-‚J These are so like the words of Lucretius

120. Orispim‘ scrinia lippi] e knew nothing about Crispinus. The fer-
· tility of his pen has profited him nothing. He was more anxious to write

much than to write well. See S. i. 4. 14, sqq. Crispinus appears in the
third Satire of this book (v. 139), where he is the only attendant of the would-
be ‘rex.’ He appears again in S. ii. 7. 45. ‘Lippi' is used for mental

SATIRE 11.

Tms Satire, the coarsest of all written by Horace, seems to have been sug-
gested by the death of Tigellius, a celebrated musician of the time. It is
irected against the tendency of men to run into extremes, and to pass from
one extreme to the other. Illustrations of this subject are drawn from the
social life of Rome. The ideas and the language are marked by a grossness
which is unusual with Horace.

 

SATIRE 111.

Tmo last Satire was, as has been said, written on ,the death of one Tigel-
lius, an eminent musician‚ a native of Sardinia, and a friend of Julius Caesar.

Some of the vices and follies of the age are attached in strong language, and

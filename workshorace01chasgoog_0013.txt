'When Augustus returned from. Asia, in n. e. 29, and closed
the gates of JanuS, being the acknowledged head of the republic,
Horace appeared among bis most hearty adherente. He wrote
cn this occasion one of his best Odes (i. 2), and employed his pen
in forwarding those reforms which it was the first object of Au-
gustus to effect. (See Introduction to osii. 15.) His most
striking Odes appear,·for the most part, to ⁴have been written after
the establishment of peace& Some may have'been written, before,
and probably were. But for some reason it would seem that he
gave himself more to lyric poetry after his thirty-fifth year than
he had dorse before. He had most iikzty studies the Greek poets
while he was at Athens, and some of his ⁴ imitations may have been
written early. If so, they were most probably improved and

polished‚ from time to time, (for he must have had them by hina,- · ι

known perhaps only· to a few friends, for many yearS,) till they
became the graceful specimens of artificial composition that they
are. Horace continued to employ himself in this kind of writing
(on a variety of subjecta convivial, amatory, political, moral, —-
some original, many no doubt suggested by Greek poems) till
Β. c. 24, when there* are reasons for thinking the first three books
of the Odes were published. During this period, Horace appears
to have passed his time at Rome, among the most distinguished
men of the day‚‚0r at his house in the country, paying occasional
visits to Tibur, Praeneste, and Baiae, with indifferent health,
which required change of air. About tbe‘ year B. o. 26 he was
nearly killed by the falling of a tree, on bis own estate, which
accident he bas recorded in one of his Odes (ii. 13), and occar-
sionally refers ¹:03 once in the same stanna with a. storm in which
he was nearly lost off Cape Palinurum? on the western coast of
Italy. When this happened, nobody knows. After tho publicae-
tion of the three books of Odes, Horace seems to have ceased
from that style of writing, or nearly so; and the only other com·-
positions we know of his having produced. in the next few years
are metrical Epistles to different friends, of which be published

a volume probably in B. c. 20 or 19. ‘He seems to have taken Ὦ

1. Villioe st'lvamm] 'I'he ‘ villicus ' was one of the principal slaves in the
‘ familia rustica,' who had the superintendence of a man s farm and ‘ villa rus-
tica) He collected his reum, looked after his slaves, and had charge of every-
thing but the cattle, of which there was a se arato super-intendent. Horace
says his woods and fields restored him to Eimself 3 that is, they gave him
liberty and enjoyment of life.

2. habitatum quinque focis] ‘ Facis ’ is put for ‘familiesff Horace says
there lived on his estate five families, the heads of which were good men,
who went up from time to time to the neighboring town of Varia. Some
suppose they were ‘coloni’ (C. ii. 14. ll, n.)‚ lessees who farmed different

6. Lanaeiae] See Introd. to C. iii. 17. ‘Insolabiliter' occurs nowhere else.

9. rumpere claustra] At the endrof the Circus were stalls ( ‘carceres ’)‚ in
which the chariots remained till the race was ready to begin. They were
then brought out, and ranged side by side behind a ro e called ‘ alba linea’
or ‘ calx‚’ which was stretched across the course, an formed a barrier, be-
yond which the chariots could not advanee ‘till the signal was given and the
rope withdrawn. It is from this obstruction‚ or from the ‘ carcereS,’ that the
metaphor in the text is taken.

13. se non eff it unquam] Compare C. ii. 16. 19.

14. Tu m tinne] He had been one of the lowest siam, used for all
manner of work-in the ‘famssia urbana‚’ and by his pitiful countenance (for
he was afraid perhaps to speak) had shown how much he wished to be de-
livered from that condition, and to be sent to work on the sarm, though that

18. eo disconvenit] ‘ To this comcs the difference between me and you!

19. tesca] ‘ Tesca ' means any rough wilderness. It is a rare word.

21. uncta popina As to ‘popina' {which Horace calls ‘uncta‚’ because
of the gneus vian s cooked there), see S. ii. 4. 62, n.

23. A us maserei] Horace writes as if hc were repeating the contempt-
uous lauguage of· the villicus. ‘That little nook of yours would produce
pepper‚ and frankincense (which of course was impossible) sooner than
ffipge. Τὲἓΐ orace mgarggvlliisogwiihevifiaefflnldo τιέξ ixzoxzatshiinolt {gl-1325 (ἐξ 3111}
before MoecenaS, we know from C. i. 20. Pepper the ancients must have
obtained, through some chantici, from India. ‘ Thus’ or ‘tus olibanum:
which is a gum-resin, exn-acted from a tree called now the Boswellia Thuri-
fera, was brought chiefly from Arabia. See virgil (Georg. i. 57) : “ India
mittit ebur, molles sua tura Sabaei.”

25. meretrix tibicina,] The ‘ tibia ’ was played by women as well as men,
and chiefly by women at meals.

26. ettamen myes] This is said with a sort of moek compassion: ‘ And
yet, poor mani (though you have none of these comforts to help you on

our way‚) you have to go on turning up the rough soil, {beding the oxen,
fooking out for floodS, and all that.’ ‘Jampridem non tacta’ implies‘ that ¹
Horace's property had been neglected before it came into his possession.
Maecenas had probabl never resided there, and perhaps he had not been
long owner of it when e5gave it to Horace. One of the dntion tha ι vana... ι

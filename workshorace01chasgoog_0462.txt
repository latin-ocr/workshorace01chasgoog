Narbonensis, to distinguish him >from M. Terentius Varro, who vis sometimes
called Reatinus. Different works are attributed to him. His attempts at
satire—,in which Horace sayS‚ most probably with justice, that he had failed
— are nowhere noticed but here. .

53. Ne! contis ›traqiei :enatat Lucilius Acci ἲ] See below, v. 65. Accius was
born Β. c. 170, and was a writer of tragcdics‚ chiefly from the Greek. Cicero
and Quintilian speak very highly of him, and the popular judgmcnt was in
his favor. ‚See Epp ii. l. 56, and A. P. 259. ’

f 5¹5. ηἵέὶι ut majore reprensis? ‘ Not as if he were superior to those he finds
au t wi ,.'

59. Quid vetat et nosmet] Horace says he is at liberty to inquire whether
it is not a natural consequence of Lucilius's temperament, and the character
of his subjectS, that he wrote verses not more polished and smooth than
might be expected of a man who was content with giving his lines the proper
number of feet, and took delight in stringing together a vast number of them
in the shortest vpossible time. ‘Pedibus quid claudere senis' explains ‘hoc‚'
‘contented merely with this,’ that is to say, comprising something (that he
calls a verse, for there is contempt in ‘ quid ') in six feet.

61. Etrusci Quale fuit Gis-si] Of this Cassius we know nothing, and what
Horace says of him is no more than a 'ocular invention that his writings
were so numerous and worthless that his diuersi pile was made of them and-
the boxes that contained them.

63. capsis] See S. 4. 22, n.

64. Fuerit] See S. i. 1. 45.

65. Οοιιιίε et urbanus ‘ Agreeable and refined!

66. Quam rudis et meeis] ‘ Allow that he is more polished than the in·
ventor of a rude style of poe-try unknown to the Greeks might be expected to
be, and than the mass of the older poets certainly were ; still, if he had lived
to this our time, he would have corrected much that he had written!

71. vivos et roderet unques] ‘ And would bite his nails to the quick,' as
men sometimes do when they are thinking very nervously.

72. Saepe stilum vertas] ‘ Stilum vertere ' means to emse what had been
written, oue end of the iron pen (Ἦ stilus ’) being broad like the end of a chisel‚
for the purpose of obliterating the letters made upon the wax tablet by the
sharp end, which they called ‘ acumen.'

75. Wibus in ludis] Such schools as Flavius’s, perhaps, if poetry was
ever taught there, or in those chcap schools in the back streets mentioned in -
Epp. i. 20. 18. The word ‘ dictari ' refers to the practice of the teachcr read-
ing out a passage for the pupil to repeat after him, one of the earliest steps in
education being accurate pronunciation. The words ‘ caneres ·‘ cantare,’
which are frequently applied to the recitation of the pupil, show that the mod-
ulation of the voice was a primary consideration in teaching. To help this
most probably was one principal purpose of the master’s reciting to his schol-
am, which was donc quite at the beginning, a-nd probably before the boys
could write ; whence Horace says (Epp. ii. 1. 126), “ Os tenerum pueri bal-
bumque poeta· figurat.'’ It was a good preparation for their subsequent train-
ing under the tcacher of rhetoric. It is a practice which might be more gen-
erally revived, for nothing can be worse than the way in which boys usually
read or re at their Iessons in our schools.

77. exp osa Arbuscula] This was a celebrated actress in Cicero's time.
As she, when she was hissed off the stage, said she cared nothing for the rest

of the spectatorS, and was satisfied if she pleased the front benches (the
Equites), so Horace says he only wants to be read in the better sort of
schoeIS‚ where that class of pcople sent their sone. . ,

78. cimex Pantilius,] This person, if it be a real name, is quite unknown.
A more contemptible animal could not have been chosen to liken the man to,

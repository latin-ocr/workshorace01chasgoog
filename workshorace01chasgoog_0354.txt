5. Chium—eadum] This is the same form of expression as “Laestry-
gonia amphora,” “ Sabina diota ’'; and the vessels were all the' same. On

the Chian wine see Sat. ii. 8. 15. The best foreign wines were Thasian, ,

Lesbian, Chian, Sicyonian, Cypriam, and Clazomenian. Only the second
and third are mentioned b Horace, who puts them together in Epod ix. 34.
They were mild wines. sbian he speaks of as ‘ innocens ' (C. i. 17..21).

ὃ. quis aquam temperet iynibus,] This is equivalent to ‘ who can give us a
bath 21 ' So Cicero, writing to Paetus, with whom he was going to (line (ad
Fam. ix. 16, sub fin.)‚ says, “ ego tibi unum sumptum afferam quod balneum
calfacias oportebit.''

8. Peliym's —fiw‘yoribusJ Cold as severe as the Peligni know, who inhab-
ited a high part of the Apennines in the Samnite territory. ⁸ Quota' means
at what hour we may sup.

9. Da lunae propere nomed The scene is suddenly shifted to the supper-
table. On the construe-tion with the genitive, see above (C. iii. 8. 13). ‘Lu-
nae novae ' means the KalendS, which was a feast day. (Compare iii. 23. 2,
‘⁸ nascentedunal') The months of N uma's calender being lunar, the associ-
ation of the new moon with the first day of the month remained after the
calendar was altered. A cup for midnight does not appear to have any other
meaning than an excuse for another toast. “Dicetur merita Nox quoque
naenia‚' he sa s below (C. iii. 28. 16).

11. tribus aut novem mscentur malleis] The ‘cyathus' was a. ladle with
which the drink was passed from t e mixing-bowl to the drinking-cup. The
ladle was of certain capacity, and twelve ‘cyathi' went to the sextarius.
Horace therefore says in effect, “ Let the wine be mixed in the proportion of
three cyathi of wine to nine of water, or of nine of wine to three of water.'’

ODE XX.

Tanna can be very little do'ubt that this Ode is imitated from the Greek.
It represents in heroic language a contest between Pyrrhus and a girl not
named, for the affectione of the handsome Nearchus The last two stanzas
furnish a striking group for a picture. The passion of the jealous girl, as
of a lioness robbed of her whesps, and the conscious pride of the beautiful
boy, are happily painted.

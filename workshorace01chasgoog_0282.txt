ODE XXII. ·

Ans-rins Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace, and the wag whom
he rgpresents as playing him false on the Sacra Via (S. i. 9. 61). Horace
and e were

‘⁸ paene gemelli,
Fraternis animis3 quicquid negat alter, et alter3
Adnuimus pariter3 vetuli notique columbi ” (Epp. i. 10).
We know nothing more of him except that he is said to have been a write?
of plays and a grammarian.

FuscuS, as usual, has not much to do with the Ode, which relat-es how a
wolf fled from the poet as he was walking in the woods on his own estate,
making verses on Lalage ; showing that an honest man is always safe.

Auentinum. -An honest man, Fuscus, may go unarmed along the burn·
ing shores of Africa, over the wild Caucasus, or to the fabulous East, As Ι
wandered careless in the woods, singin of mg Lalage, a wolf, such as Apu·
lia and Africa rear not, met me, and ed! et mein the cold and stormy
North or in the burning and uninhabitetl tropic, still will Ι love my smiling,
prattlsng Lalage.

· l. Inteyer vitae scelerisque purus} These are GrecismS, but not peculiar- to
Horace. virgil, for instance, has ‘ animi maturus Aletes ’ (Aen. ix. 246 );

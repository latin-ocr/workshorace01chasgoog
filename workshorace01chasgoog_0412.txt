Horace says, ‘ Nor shal his firmncss yield to thy beauty‚ if 110 hate it once,
when settled pain has entered his soal?

19. licebit This use of the future tense shows that ‘ licet ’ and some other
words, whic are called by the grammarians conjunctions, are in fact only
verbs, after which ‘ ut’ is understood. ‘ Licebit’ is used below (S. ii. 2. 60),

ace mourns over the civil warS, and proposes that all good citizens shall mi-
grate to the Fortunate Islands.

Anouumvr. — Another age is wasting in civil wars. She whom no enemy
could tame, shall be destroyed by hcr own accursed children 3 the wild beast
shall devour her ; the barbarian shall trample upon her, and scatter the dust
of her Romulus to the winds.

What are we to do ’.ἱ Go forth like the PhocoeanS, leave our homes and
our temples to be the dens of beasts, and go wherever the winds shall wast
uS. Shall it be so ’.ἱ Then why delay ’.ἰ But let us swear :—When rocks
shall swim, and the Po shall wash the 10ρο of MatinuS, and the Apennine be
cast into the sea3 when the tiger shall lie with the hind, and the dove with
the hawk, and the herds sear not the lion, and the he-goat shall love 1110
waves‚ -then we will return to our home. Thus let the nobler spirits re-
solve, while the craven clings to' his‘ couch. For us there are those happy
isles where the earth yields her harvests and the trees their fruit, unbidden ς
where honey drops from the Oak, and the stream leaps babbling from the
hills; where the goat comes unbidden to the milk-pail, and udders are full,
and the fold fears no beasts, and the ground bears no vipers3 where the rain-
110οᾶ and the drought are not known 3 whither the venturous sail comes not;
where the flock is unhurt by pestilence or heat. Jove destined these shores
for the pious, when the golden age had passed away, and thither the pious
may resort and prosper. ⁴

, δὲ. Altera] The last being that of Sulla, which ended about forty years
ore.

3. Marsi] This refers to the Social War, mentioned in C. iii. 14. 18.

4. Porsenae] The penultimate syllable of this name is usually long, bnt it
is here short. Porsena was king of Clusium, in Etruria. He espoused the
cause of Tarquinius Superbus, and attackcd Rome with a large army. The
Roman legends of Cocles, who defended the bridge, of Cloelia, who with her
maidens swam over the river, and of Mucius Scaevola, who thrust his hand
into the fire, are all connected with this period. Though the Roman histori-
ans have thrown disguises over the fact, there is every reason to believe that

Porsena reduced the city to submission, and took from her all the territory ¹ -

she had obtained 1101111ἑ1ξ 1110 Tiber. '

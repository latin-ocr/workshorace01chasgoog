also ‘candidi Favonii’ (Ο. iii. ⁷. 1) and ‘albus Iapyx' (Ο. iii. 2219). In
the latter place it represents a treacherous wind. Horace prefers the older
forms in ‘e0‚’ as ‘deterget‚’ ‘tergere’ (S. ii. 2. 24), ‘densentur' (C. i.

19. ,ζῖιὶφωεία siquis] The standards in front of the ‘ praetorium,’ the com·
mandet-in00hief’s quartem, were decorated with plates of bumished gold or
silver.

21. Teucer] Teucer was brother of Ajax, and son of Telamon, king of
SalamiS, that island on the southern coast of Attica where Themistocles
defeated the forces of Xerxes. When he returned from Tro , his father
refused to receive him, because he came without his brother, w ereupon he
went with his followers to Cyprus, and built a city there, which he called
after his native place, Salamis. ‘ Cum fugeret tamen ’ is an imitation of the

Greek καὶ φεύγων ὅμως. But this use of ‘tamen' is not uncommon in
Cicero. Teucer selected Hercules as his protector, and so wore a erown of
poplar, which was sacred to that hero. See Virg. Aen. viii 276.

25. Fortuna melior parente] ‘ Fortune, kinder than my father?

27. duce et auspice] Horace puts technical distinctions into Teucer-’s lips, ’
of which he could know nothing. The commender-in-chief of a Roman

alone had the power of taking the auspices under-which the war was can-ied
on. The difference between ‘ dux ' and ‘ auspex ' was the differenee between
a commender who had the ‘ imperium ' (and therefore the ‘ auspicium ') and
one who had not. If an ‘imperator’ commanded in person, the war was
said to be carried on under his ‘ ductus ' as well as his ‘ auspicia '; otherwise
only under his ‘auspicia,' his ‘legatus ' being the ‘dux.' Thus Tacitus
says (Anu. ii. 41), “recepta signa cum Varo amissa ductu Germanici au-
spiciis 'l'iberii.'' Tiberius as ‘ imperator’ alone had the ⁴ auspicium,’ which
the emperors rarely delegated to their generals. See last Ode, v. 4. C. iv.

Ζεὺς χῶ Διὸς Φοῖβος σαφής (Oed. Col. 623).

luxurious. The name, which was roverbial though the town had long

been destroyed, is given to this you by way of representing the character
into which e has fallen.

Anemurium—Lydia, why art thou spoiling Sybaris thuS, so that he
shuns all manly exerciscs'l He who was once so active, why does he tio
longer ride and swim and wrestle, and throw the quoit and javelin in the
Campus Martius? Why does he hide himself with thee, like Achilles, in
woman's apparel?

used to raetise manly and warlike exercises.
5. mi ituris] ‘ as a soldier should.'

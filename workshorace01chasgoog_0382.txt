ef the early down upon a boy's cheek. The word is nowhere else used in

this sense. Ἀπτιλος was a name given by the Greeks to beardless boys.
Boys’ hair was allowed to grow till they assumed the ⁸ toga virilis,’ when
it was cut off, as observed on C. ii. 5. 24. The feathers of a bird are as good
a likeness to the down on a oung cheek as wool, from which ‘ lanug0, the
usual word in this sense, is erived.

6. te speculo videris] ‘ Speculo ' here, without ‘in,' is the ablative of the
instrument. ‘Alterum ⁹ is nowhere else used exactly in this sense, ‘muta-

tum‚' and, though the word admits of that use, it is so like the Greek ἕτερον,
which is frequently so used, that Ι think it is a translation of that word.
‘ Heu ' is an exclamation of the poet, not of Ligurinas. What follows is like
two lines in Terence (Hec. i. 1. 17, sq.) :—
“ Eheu me miseram ! cur non aut istaec mihi

Aetas et forma est aut tibi haec sententia? '’
The mirrors of the Romans at this time were only of metal, glass mirrors
having been introduced later, and then of an inferior quality.

 

ODE XI.

Tms Ode professes to be an invitation to Phyllis to come and sup with
Horace on the 15th of April, Maecenas's birthday. It is possible that the
Ode was sent to Maecenas himself, and was only thrown into the form of an
address to Phyllis for poetical convenience.

Anemnmr. — I have a good old amphora of Alban, with parsley and ivy
to make thee a crown, Phyllis; silvei· on my board, and an altar that waits
for the sacrifice3 the slaves are busy, the flre is buming3 come and celebrate
the Ides of April, for it is Maecenas's birthday, more sacoed to me than my
own. Telephus is matched already, and is no match for thee. The fates of
Phaethon and Bellerophon teach thee to beware of ambition. Come, m
{last love, with thy sweet voice sing the song 1 shall tcach thee; song shall

rive care away. ⁸

2. Albam· eadum] The wine of the Alban hills was of the better kind3
and at Nassidienus’s sup r it was offered to the chief guest with Falernian
(Sat. ii. 8. 16). Pliny (gg. H. xiv. 6) places it third among the wines of
Italy. Juvenal (v. 33) speaks of Albanian wine, and classes it with Setian,
both of great age. The rich glutton drank it, he says, as a con-ective of yes-

blood on birthdays. In the earliest times, perhaps they did not, but the

10. cursitant mixtae paen‘s puellam] ‘Puellae’ is most rarely used for
female slaves. The w'ord in use was ‘ ancillae! ·

12. Ver-tice stantuna] ⁴ Vei-tice ' is the top of the flame, which ‘flickers
as it whirls the dark smoke on its crest’ 3 a spiral fleme, terminating in a
column of smoke. It seems as if Horace were writing with a fire burning
before him, and caught the idea as he wrote.

15. marinae] C. i. 3. 1. Venus (Ἀφροδίτη) was said to have risen from
the sea in the mouth of April, which was therefore her mouth, the name of

which Macrobius derives from ἀφρός : Varro, more probably, from ‘ aperio,’

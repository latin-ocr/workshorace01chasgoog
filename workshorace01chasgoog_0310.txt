C. VALGIUS RUFUS was a poet of much merit, and appears to have been
sad for the loss of a young slave. At a time of public rejoicing (probably at
the closin of the temple of JanuS, B. c. 24, aster the Cantabri had been 4put
down by ugustuS, C. ii. 6. 2, n.), Valgius is called upon (as Tibullus was·
in C. i. 33) to cease from writing mournful verses on his 1088, and to turn his
thoughts to the praises of Augustus.

Auentinum— The rain does not always fall, nor the storms ragejnor the
{rost-continue for ever, Valgius. But thou mournest for Mystes from morn-
ing till night. Nestor did not always· weep for AntilochuS‚ nor his parents

3. inaequales] This epithet is equivalent to ‘informes,' ‘ shapeless,' which
{s ¹a5 way of expressing anything that is rough (C. ii. 10. 15). See C. i.

The table-lanus of Armenia are intensely cold in winter, and covered with
snow and ice. The Summers are hot and dry.

in the bold promonotory of the same name, now called Punta di Viesti. It '

13. ter aevofunctus] ‘who had thrice completed the (usual) age of man!
Cic. (de Senectut. c. 10) sayS, “ Nestor tertiam jam aetatem hominum vive-
bat-'³ The foundation for the story is found in Homer (11. i. 250) :—

ἥδη δύο μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων
ἐφθίατο - μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν.
The duration of an age cannot now be determined.

14. Antilochum] AntilochuS, the son of Nestor and friend of Achilles, was
killed by Memnon (Odyss. iv. 188). He was famed for his beauty aud man-
liness, as well as for his filial iety. ,

16. Troilon] The death o Troilus, son of Priam and Hecuba, who was
killed by Achilles, is related by Visqi'l (Aen. i. 474), following, not Homer,
but some of the Cyclic poets (see A. . 136, n.), the event having taken place
before the time at which the Iliad opens. His sisters were Creusa, Polxxena,
Laodice, and Cassandra.

17. Desine mollium] A Greek construction; as ‘abstineto irarum’ (C. iii.
2⁷. 69), ‘abstinens pecuniae’ (iv. 9. 37). Virgil too (Aen. x. 441) takes
the same license, ‘ tempus desistere pugnae! ‘ Damnatus laboris ' (C. ii. 14.
19), ‘decipitur laborum’ (C. ii. 13. 38), ‘ Ciceris invidit’ (S. ii. 6. 84), are
other constructions with the genitive horrowed from the Greek.

20. riyidtem Niphatend Niphates was a mountain-range east of the Tigris.
The name means the snow-mountain. Perhaps a part of it may have been
covered with perpetual snow. The anns of Augustus were first carried into
Armenia in B. c. 20 (Epp. i. 3, Int.) 3 we must therefore suppose Horace to
be speaking of conquests to come, as he does in C. i. 12. 53, sqq.

21. Medumque flumen] The Euphrates· ‘ Flumen ' is the subject of ‘ vol·

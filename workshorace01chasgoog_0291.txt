ODE XXX.

I‘r is not im robable that the main incident of this Ode, that of a lady
sacrificing or edicating a little chapel to Venus, is taken from life; but

there is a fragment of one of Alcman's poems‚ running Κύπρον ἱμερτὰν
1λίἷζέιὲοίῖὶιῷιει) τ’«ἔξέἐέφον περίῤῥυτον, which appears to have been imitated in the

Anommnr. — Royal Venus, leave th belovod C rus, and come, dwell
in Gl cera's temple. Let Love come wi thee, and t e Graces and Nympha,
and outh, who is unlovely without thee, and Mercury too.

Graces clothed; afterwards it became the fashion to represent them naked ς
but the latest practice lay between the two, and they were painted and sculp-
tured with loose, transparent drapery. Horace varies in his descriptione.
See C. i. 4. 65 iii. 19. 163 iv. 7. 6.

7. Et parum comis sine te Juventas] Cupid (‘ fervidus puer ’) or several
Cupids (C. 19. l), Youth (Ηβη), HermeS, the god of eloquence, Persuasion
(Πειθώ), and the Graces‚ were the principal companious of VenuS, accord—

ing to the notions of the Greeks. The nymphs of the woodS‚ or of the hilis,
were likewise usually represented as her compamons. (See C. iv. 6.)

 

ODE XXXI.

ΙΝ no. 28 (25th October), Aug-ustus dedicated a temple, with a library -

attached, which he had built in honor of ApoUO, on the PalatIne Hm, to
commemorate his victory at Actium. After the ceremonies of the day of
dedication were over, we may suppose Horace putting in his own claIm to
the god's favor in this Ode, in which he represents himself as offex-ing a
libation (whether in private or at the temple is uncertain), and asking for
that which, according to Juvenal (x. 356), should be the end of all prayer,
‘ mens sana in corpore sano! ’

Antonianum—What asks the t of Apollo? Not cups, or herbe, or
gold and ivory, or rich fields. t those who may prune Calenian vinea,
and rich merchants drink rich wine out of cups of old, favorites of heaven
who traverse the deep in safety. My food is the offive, the chicory, and the,
mallow. Let me enjoy what I have, thou son of Lato, souud in body and
mind, and let my age pass with honor and the lyre.

1. dedicatum] This word is applied to the god as well as his temple.
So Cic. de N. 1). ii. 33, sayS, “ ut Fides ut Mens quas iu Capitolio dedicatas
vidimus proxime a M. Aemilio Scauro.”

2. novun-21, Libations· were made ‘wlth wine of the current year.

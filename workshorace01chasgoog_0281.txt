1. Vile putabis πιοᾶἰσίε Sabinum authuris} It has been said before (C. 9.
7, ιι.) that Sabine wine was none of the worst; bnt it was cheap and poor
eom with the best, to which Maecenas was used, and this probably had
not ad the benefit of keeping. Horace commende it, therefore, by referi-lug
to the circumstancessunder which it was bottled (as we should say).- The
most ordinary kind of earthen-ware jug was called ‘ eandm-us: supposed
w be the name of its inventor. Horace had tried to improve his wine b
putting} 321 ing} a ‘ testa ’ or ‘ amphora,' which had contained some of the ri
wine 0 e gean.

3. levi,] The cork of the ‘ testa ’ was covered with pitch or gypsum
aster the wine was put into it, and this Horace says he did with his own
hand. He would at the same time seal it with his own scal, and attach to it
a label with the date, and he could so vouch for its being the wine hc speaks
of. And when he says he did it with his own hand, be means also to
show the pains he had taken to celebrate Maecenas’s recovery. ‘ Condere ’
aad ‘ diffugdem7’ we›re the words used for pntting the wine into the ‘ am·

0ra.’ 2. 9. , n. · ,

p 5. Οω-ε( Mamm aqum] Maecenas was content with the equom-ian rank,
and would take no higher: hence the frequent repetition of the title ‘ eques ’
by Horace and others. (See C. iii. 16. 20.) It appears that Maeeenas re·
covered from a bad attack of sever the same year that Horace was nearly
killed by the falling of a nee, and the first time he went to the theatre after
his recovery the pco le received him with applause. The circumstance is
referred to again in Cp ii. 17. 22, sq

7. Vaticani Montis imayo] The theatre must have been that of Pompeius,
which was opposite to the Vatican hill, on the left bank of the river, the hill
being on the right or Etruscan bank, which gives propriety ω the words
iiffoergifumissils rigae? The second syllable of Vaticanus is long in Mar-

an uvcn .

10. Tu bibes] The future has herc the same signification as above, C. 6.
1, 7. l. ‘ You may drink, if you please, the richer wines. 1 have none such.'
‘ Caecubum ’ was thennest sort of wine in Horaee's time. ‚ It was grown in
the ‘ Caecubus agei-,³ in Latium, at the head of the bay of Amyclae. The
Calenian was from Cales (now Calvi) in Campania. Close by Cales was
the ‘ Falernus ager,’ which produced several varieties of the best uality.

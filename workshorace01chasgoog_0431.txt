ers, as rant and emptiness will always have, and that they made him a pres·
ent, by way of a testimonial as it is called, of a set of handsome ⁶ capsae and
a bust. The ‘ capsa' was a round box, suited to hold one or more rolled
volumes. The larger sort was called ‘ scrinium.’

22. cum mea nmo] See Introduction. That Horace wrote many pieccs
which have not been preserved, appears clear from this passage and v.
71, s .

233211190 recitare timentis] See note on v. 73. The usage which leaves
the personal pronoun to be inferi-ed from the possessive, is common both in
Greek and Latin. (See C. iii. 22. 6.) Compare Ovid (Heroid. v. 45) z “ Et
flesti, et nostros vidisti flentis ocellos.” ‘ Timeo ' and ‘ metuo ’ do not gov-
ern an infinitive mood in the prose-writings of Horace's day. ‘ Vereor ’ is
used in that construction.

24. sunt quos] ‘ There are some who are b no means pleased with this
sort of writing‚ as being for the most part wort y of censure themselves? As
to ‘sunt quos,' see C. i. l. 3, n. He seems ω have particulas persons οι·
classes in view.

26. Aut ob avaritiam] ‘ Laborare ob ’ is an unusual construction, and the
sentence begins with one form of expression and ends with another. ‘ Am—
bitio ’ generally had an epithet of a strong kind a plied to it. Horace has
‘prava,’ ‘inanis,’ ‘mala,' ‘misera' 3 and Cicero ( Off. i. 26) says, “Mi-
serrima est omnino ambitio honorumque contentio.'' The practice, therc-
fore, seems to have been habitual, which, ‚if we consider the evils that arose
out of personal ambition, and the eagerncss with which places of honor wenc
sought at all times of the Republic‚ is not surprising.

28. Hunc capit arqenti splendor ς] Cups and other vessels curicusly
wrought in silver and Corinthian bronze, and very costly (such as Juvenal
describeS, S. i. 76), were among the many objects of extravagance at Rome.
The exaggerated admiration of the persons Horace alludes to, for such works
of art, might bc comparativcly harmless, if it did not lead them into dishonest
ways of acquiring them, and beggaring their families,as Albius did, of whom
we know nothing. His son is mentioned below (v. 108), as living in want
through his father-’s extravagance. ‘ Stupet,' with the ablative, occurs below
(S. 6. 17) ; and ‘torpere,' an equally strong word, is used in the same con-
nection in S. ii. 7. 95.

29. Hic mutat merces] See C. i. 31. 12, n.

euryente a sole, etc.] This means from east to west (“ad ortus Solis ab
Hesperio cubili,'’ C. iv. 15. 15). ‘ Mutare merces ' can hardly be applied to
any but a mercator. ‘ Mala ' means dangers and hardships. '

34. Faenum imber:¹ ²⁶3⁸ corvam] A law of the XII. Tables gave an action to ,

such a way as to warn passengers, and ena le them to get out of its way.
Hence the proverb, “ He has a wisp of hay on his horn.''

37. afiarno] ‘ Fui-nus ’ is the bakehonse, to which the lower sort of peo-
ple‚ old women and children, carried their bread to be baked. ‘ Lacus’ were
tanks distributed in all parts of the city, into which water was conveyed from
the aqueducts, and to which poorer persons resorted who could not afford to
have water· laid on at their houseS.

38. Ayequmfl ‘ Dum‚’ as an enclitic, significa ‘awhile ' ς ‘agedum‚' ‘come
a moment.

39. Primum eqo me illorum] ‘ Primum ’ means ‘in the first place ' 3 before

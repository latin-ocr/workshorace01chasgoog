418 nores.

60. Postquam Discordia tetra] The Scholiasts imply that 11118 is a verse of
Eamus, but they do not say from what poem it is taken. Virgil (Aen. i. 294)
has “ claudentur belli portae.'' As to the position of ‘ non,’ see S. 6. 1.

63. alias justum sit necne poema,] The question he has been discussing
since v. 38, namely‚ whether he and such as he are 01· are not properly called
poets, is not resumed, though we may perceive that Horace does not consider
that 1118 arguments have quite settled it. He goes on to show that the public
have no reason 10 110 afraid of him.

65. Sulcius aoer Ambulat et Gap-ius] These persons are said by the Scho-
liasts to have been public informem, or else ‘ causidici,' ‘ pleaderS,’ and Hor-

afraid of them. ‘ elatore8‚' ⁴ infomerS,' were more common in after years,
but they were sufficiently abundant in Horace's time. Caelius and Birrus are
· said by Acron to have been rofligate youthS, meaning probably that they

71. Nulla taberna meos habeat] In the next place, he has no wish to see his
books in the shops and thumbcd by the vulgar. The ‘taberna ’ was some-
times under a porticae, 111 which case the titlcs of the books for sale within
were hung u on the columns (‘ pilae ’) in front. Horace alludes to this when
he says (A. ἕ. 372), “ Mediocribus esse poetis Non Dii, non homines, non
concessere columnae,'' which means that indifferent 'pocts would not be pat-
ronized by the booksellers. ‘ Habeat’ expresses a wish. On Hermogenes

73. Nec recito cuiquam] Nor does he go about reciting his works in pub-
lic. This practice grew to be an intolerable nuisance in the course of time.

even strangers, and annoying the neighbors while they gratified themselves.
Round the baths were spaces called ‘ scholae! On these, people sat or
walked about, and conceited authors could tcase their a naintance and the
stt-angers that were compelled to listen to them, and in e act of bathing
they could do the same.

77. haud illud quaerentes,] ‘ Illud ' is thus used commonly to introduce
something about to be mentioned.

78. Laedere qaudes, Inquit‚] Horace has said, that, even if he does write 01·
100110, it is only in a rivate way, and 110 0110 therefore need be afraid of him.
He now disposes of t 0 charge of writing with malicious intent. ‘ Studio ' is
used adverbially, ‘ of set purpose in your malignity you do it.'

80. Est auctor quis denique eorum] ‘ Quis ’ may be taken as an interrogar-
tive or an enclitie. It is not easy to decide. As to ‘auctor‚' see C. i. 28.

84. commissa tacere Qut· nequit ‚· This, which is too commonly softened
into a wcakneSS, the inability to eep a secret, Horace very justly marks as
one of the most prominent signs of a mischievous character. See C. 111. 2.

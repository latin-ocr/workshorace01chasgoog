ODE 1.

Tms Ode is addressed to C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and eompanion in
arms of Julius Coesar. In mc. 40 he was consul, and in the following year
he was sent by M. Antonius against the Parthini, a tribe of Illyricum, and
having defeated and subdued them he was allowed a triumph on his return
to Rome. He then betook himself to literature, aud raetising as an orator
in the courts of justice, and speaking in the senate. fle patronized literary
men, built a libr-ary, wrote poetry, particularly tragedies, aud composed a
history of the civil wars, in most of which he had taken an active part. The
Ode was written after hearing Pollio recito part of this work, a practice
which he is said to have been the first to introduce among literary meu at
Rome.

Anemmnr.— The civil wurs, their causes, their proffiesS, and their fatal
results, — a dangerous task is thino, and treacherous is , e ground thou art
Ἣ· the hagie Muse for a little while, and thou shalt return to her when
thou hast finished the historian’s tnsk, Ο Pollio! advocate, senator, con-
queror! Even now I seem to hear the trumpet and the clarion, the flash-
ing of armS, and the voices of chiefs, and· the whole world subdued ‚but the

1. Mtum ex Metello consule] The foundation of the civil wars is here laid
in the formation of the (so-called) triumvir-ate by Caesar, Pompeius, and
Crassus, which took place in ⁴the consulship of Ω. Caecilius Metellus Celer,
and L. Afraniae, A. u. c. 694, Β. c. 60. But though this was the first great
act of aggression on the liberties of Rome, the civil war did not break out
till the year A. u. c. 704, n. c. 50, when Caesar and Pompeius came to their
final rupture. Pollio's work was in seventeen books, and probably ended
with the battle of Actium.

4. Principum amicitias The allianec ο Coesar and Pompeius, and the
subsequent coalition of . Antonius and AugustuS, more thau once broken
and renewed, and always maintained at the expense of the people's liberties,
and therefore called ‘ graves,’ ‘ o pressive,’ are here principally referred to.
See Plutarch, Vit. Caes. e. 13. ollio was himself the means of reconciling
Antonius and AugustuS, in the year of his consulship B. c. 40.

5. Nondum expiatis uncta cruon'bus,] See C. i. 2, Introduction. The 29th
verse of that Ode, “ Cui dabit partes scelus expiandi,” compared with this,
makes it probable the two were written about the same time. The plural

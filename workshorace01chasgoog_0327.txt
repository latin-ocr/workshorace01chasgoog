Tms and the five following Odes are nerall admitted to be among the
finest specimens of Horace's manner. t has n already said (C. ii. 15,
Introduction) that they a pear all to have been written about the same time
with one another and wit other Odes, namely, that time when Augustus set
himself the task of social reformation, aster the close of the civil wars.

d 'ljhe general pur-port of this Ode is an exhortatiou to moderate living and
es1res. -

The first stanza is generally understood to have been added as an introduc-

3. Musarum εαοατὶοι] Ovid calls himself the same (Amor. iii. 8.23) :—

“ Ille ego Musarum purus Phoebi ue sacerdos.’'

possesses more lands than another.

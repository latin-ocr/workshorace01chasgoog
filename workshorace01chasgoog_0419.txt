that of the ‘orator’ οι· ‘ atronus! If we are to believe this statement of
Horace, and another to t e same effect (Epp. ii. 1. 103), we must suppose
that these learned persons sacrifioed their own convenience to the anxie? of

' 11. datis vadibus] ‘ Vades ’ were sureties provided b the defendant, to
secure his appearance before the praetor at a time agree upon between the
plaintiff and himself. If he did not appear, he forfeited tho amount of the
‘ vadimonium ' or ement, and his ‘ vades ' were liable to pay it if he did
not (see S. 9. 36, n. . The erson here represented, mereforQ is the defend-
ant in an action, going up xessctantly to Rome, to appear before the praetor
according to his ement. ‘ Ille ’ is as if the man were before us.

14. Delassare ent] Though ‘ delasso ' does not occur elsewhere, there is
no reason to suspect the word, or alter it. The intensive force of ‘ de ' is well
added to ‘ lasso! It corresponds to κατ-ἆ, which has the same force. who
Fabius was, it is impossible even to conjecture with probability.

15. Si quis Deua] This is not a Roman way of speaking, but Greek, εἷ

27. Sed tamen amoto] ‘ Sed,’ ‘sed tamen‚’ ‘veruntamen,’ are often used,
and especially by cicero, not to express op osition, but after a parenthesis or

28. Ille yravem] The cause of that discontent which was spoken of at the
beginning is here traced to the love of monev, ench man thinking that his
neighbor is getting it faster than he is„and wishing therefore to change places

, with him. But Horace does not mean that to be the only solution of the

universal discontent. That would be absurd, and one at least of his own
exam les would contradict his theory, the jurisconsultus, who did not pul-sue
his la orious vocation for pa . He therefore shifts or limits his ground a
little, and dwells upon that which he sup oses to be the most prevalent cause
of discontent; and with his ground he changes his examples. ‘ Nauta' and
‘mercator ’ here are the same person, the trader navigating his own ship.

9. fertis rumore secundo ε] .‘ Rumore secundo ’ is a phrase which occurs in
various combinatione. Vir-gil (Aen. viii. 90) has “ Ergo iter inee tum cele·
rant rumore secundo‚'' where Wagner applies it to the song of e rewers,
Tacitus, speaking of the honors confer-md on Nero, sayS, ‘⁸ ut haee secundo
rumore ita adversis animis acceptum, quod filio Claudii socer Sejanus desti·
naretur'’ (Ann. iii. 29). He uses ‘ adverso rumore ' iu the opposite sense
(xiv. 11). Here it means with an unanimous assent, or loucl assent.
10. clivus liba recusem He likens himself to the slave who ran away
from e priest‚ his master, use he fed him too much on the sweet cakoe 1
offered in sacrifice. He got tired of them, and wanted plainer food. These

’ 12. Vivere natum] See S. i. 1. 49, n.: “quid referat intra Naturae fines
viventi.’' Horace considers the artificial state of society and mode of life in
large townS, as all must, to be a wider departure from the natural condition
of man than a country life.

13. Ponendaeqzoe domo] There are three forms of this dative, ‘ domui,'
‘ dom0‚' ‘ domi.' ‘Area ' is an open space, here for building on. The
technical meaning of it is given on C. i. 9. 18.

15. plus &meant hiemes,] See S. ii. 3. 10, ιι.

16. rabiem Canis et momenta Leonis] See C. iii. 13. 8, ιι. 3 29. 18, n.
‘Iliiomental' here seems to mean the violence of the heat that accompanies
t is conste lation.

19. Deterius Libycis olet] Horace asks whether the field, covered with
flowcrs‚ smclls less sweet and looks less beautiful than marble floor3‚ laid
with mosaic pictures and strewed with flowers, or other persumes. Respect-
ing the Libyan and other marbleS, see C. ii. 18. 3, ιι. By ‘lapillis ’ Horace
means the small pieees of different mai-bles with which the floors were laid,
‘tessellae ' or ‘ crustum: as they were called. Such pavementS, which are
now so eostly as onl to be found in the richest houses, were formerly very
common in Italy. hey were wrought in eolored mai-bles, or the more or-
dinary ones in white and black. “

m. aqua tendit rumpere plumbum] ‘ Plumbum ' means leaden pipcS, which
were called ‘ fistulae! Cisterns were called ‘ castella,’ and there were three
sorts: ‘publica‚' which received the water intended for public purposes;
‘ privata,’ which were the common property of several persons who clubbed
together to build it, and laid on pipes to conduct the water to their ‘ castella
domestica,’ the cisterns they had in their own houseS. These pipes therefore
intersected the whole city. As mentioned before (S. i. 4. 37, n.)‚ those who
could not afford to have water laid on at their houseS, resorted to the ‘lacus '

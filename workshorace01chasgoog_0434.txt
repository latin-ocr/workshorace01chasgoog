bram hospitalem consociam amant '’ (C. ii. 3. 10). ‘ Quavis ’ is ‘qua ratione

⁵⁸ 913. Ρῒεῑῖλοέδλῖαχϋίω οἶες] Τ1118 verse is quoted from a former Satira
(2. 27) only to show thc innocent subjects with which Horace’s satire dealt,
and he goes on to show that his satire has none of the malignity which is
common in society. ⁴ Pastillus ’ is a diminutive form of ⁸ panis,' and signifies
‘ a. small roll,' whence in a derived sense it came to mean small balls of per-
sume. Who Rufillus and Gargonins may have been, we cannot telL

some stories, with stealin the golden crown from the statue of Jupiter w en
he was in charge of the apitol3 That he was tried on some serious chaffie
and acquitted, and that the verdict 11111 not escape seandal, 18 clear from e
context. See also S. 10. 26. Τ110 nature of the accusation must remain a.
matter of doubt. We may also gather that he was a person of influence from
v. 97, which he must have been, if he was acquitted, or supposed to have
been aequitted, through the corruption of the jury.

95. ut tuus est mos .· J ‘ In our peculial· way,’ that is, sarcastically.

99. Sed tamen admiror, here is sarcasm in thia, which Horace calls
‘ succus loliginis,' the dar secretion of the cuttle·fish, blaek and malignant.

any instances of a double accusative after ‘suesco ’ except this. The con-

108. quod fni ipss parasset .·] Horace’s father had lived-a life of frugal in-
dustry, and, 111 addition to any ‘peculium ’ he may have laid by as a ‘servus,'
he made enough money by 1118 occupatiori of ‘ coactor' (S. 6. 86) to purchase

a farm of no great value at Venusia, to pay for his son's educatron at Rome,
aud enable him to continue it at Athens.

nothing is known, is to be distin ishcd from the coxcomb in the sixth Satira
(v. 30). Sectanius (otherwise cctanius) is not more known than Barrus.
Trebonius was the name of a plebeian gens of some distinction, but which of
them Horace alludes to, it is impossible to say.

reasons as to what is best to bc avoided and what to be soug t3 1 am satisfied

mind to refine upon the foundation of morals, nor any pretension to a philo-
sophical view of these matters. He knew that right was right and wrong was

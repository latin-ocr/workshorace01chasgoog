⁷. Liris] This river, now called Garigliano, took its rise near tlie Lacus
micinae, in the country-of the AEqui, and, passing through the ric-hest part
of Latium, emptied itself below Minturnae into the sea (S. i. 5. 40, n.). Tlle
upper part of the stream is much broken by waterfalls. Horace's description
a plies only to the lower part, where, havin left the Apennines and joined
[ξε Trerus (Sacco), it‘flows quietly thro 11 e cultivated lands of Latium.

12. Vina Sym reparata merca] Wine taken in exehange for Syrian goede,
which includes all the costly merchandise of the East; elsewhere called
‘ Tyriae merces? The seaportsr of Syria were entrepots for goods from and
for the East, and were frequented by a vast number of ships from all parts⁸ —
Horace uses many words compounded with ‘ re ’ without any perceptible
difference of meaning from the simple words, as ‘ reti-actare? ‘ resecare,’ ‘ re-
solvem,’ ‘ revincere: ‘ renaress ‘ remittere.’ But there is the force of barser-ing

in this word, as in ἀνταγοράζεσθαι. (See C. i. 37. 24, 11.) ‘ Mercator ’ was
a dealer in wares who generally sailed or travelled into foreign parts· The
‘ mercatores ’ were an enterprising elasa,‚and penetrated into barbarous and
distant countries and dangerous seas. The mention of the Atlantic is a little
out of place, immediately after ‘ Syra merce ’ς but, as usual, Horace writes
generally, and does not aim· at strIct ‘accuracy. ‘ Aequor Atlanticum ’ suited
his verse. The travellin merchants are often referred to by Horace. See

ODE XXXII.

Tms is an addi-ess of the poet to his lyre, calling upon it to help him now,
and whenever he shall, require its aid.

- Anemuri-tr. — I am asked to sing. 1f1 have ever composed a song that
shall not· die, with thee, my lyre, come, help me eo a Latin song, -thou,
whom Alcaeus did first touch, who, in the field or on the deep, still sung of
Liber, the Musca, Venus and her sou, and Lym, with dark eyes and hair.

Thou ¹{lory of Phoebus, welcome at the table of the gods r; thou consoler of
my to' S, help me whenever I shall invoke thee.

1. Poscimur.] ‘ Poscitur a nobis carmen.’ This may mean that the poetic
afflatus is on him, and he feels called upon to sing.

2. Si quid vacui] ‘ If ever, at my ease under the ellade, with thee Ι have
sung aught that shall live this year, yea more.’

4. Barbite‚] Βάρβιτος is used as a feminine noun by the early Greek
writers. The later make it masculine. Here it is masculine, and in C.

5. Lesbio—civi] Alcaeus of Mytilene (C. 1. 34, n.). He fought in the

from the Greek, cannot be determined.

Anummwr. — Weep not, Asterie3 Gyges is faithful, and will return with
the spring, a rich man. He has been driven to Oricum, and is weeping with

doors and listen not to his songS.

2. Favonii] See C. i. 4. 1. Favonius, according to Pliny (ii. 47), blew
‘ ab occasu aequinoctiali,’ that ie, due west. It would therefore be a favorable
wind for a vessel coming down the Adriatic, and not very unfavorable for
sailing up the west coast of Italy. It would be in her teeth as she tried to
make the Straits of Messina. But Horace's winds are not more studied than
his places and persons. The lover is waiting till the weather changes and
the winds are mild and favorable. The Favonii are called ‘ candidi,’ as No-
tus and Iapyx are each called ⁴ albus ’ (C. i. 7. 15; iii. 27. 19ἰ.

3. Thyna merce] The Thyni and Bithyni were orig-ina ly two different
peoples of Thrace, who migrated into Asia Minor and displaced the nativeS.
For some time they continued separate, but when Horace wrote, the distine-
tion was not observed, and ‘ Thyna merx ’ was Bithynian merchandise (Epp.
i. 6. 33). Bithynia, after it became a Roman province, included a great part
of Pontus, and so comprised nearly- the whole seaecoast of Asia Minor, and
all the trade along that coast would come under the title of ‘ Thyna merx!

4. fide,] The genitive. The older forms of genitives of this declension
were four, ‘es,' ‘ei‚' ‘i,’ and ‘e.’

5 Oricum This was a town in EpiruS, situated at the top of the bay
fonned by t e Acroceraunian promontory. See Aen. x. 136: “ Oricia tere-
bintho.f”O The constellation of the goat Amalthea (Capra) rises at the begin-
nin ›- ο cto ›er.

lgl. Dicens {quibus uri,] ‘Ignibus ' is used as Ovid uses it (Am. iii. 9. 56),
“ vixisti dum tuus ignis eram.’' We may understand C. i. 27. 16, “ Non
erubescendis adurit Ignibu5,‘' in the same way, i. e. the flame put for the per-
son who causes it.

12. Tentat mille vafir modia] On ‘ tentat,' sce note on C. iii. 4. 71.

13. mulier perfida Antea or Sthcnobaea‚ wife of Proetus, king of Argos,
fell in love with Bel erophonteS, and when he rejected her proposals, she ac-
cused him to her husband, as Potipha‘r's wife accused Joseph.

14. Falsis impulerit] ‘ Impello ' is used with the infinitive mood by Taci-
tus (Aun. xiii. 543 xiv. 60). The common construction is with ‘ut,’ as (Epp.
ii. 2. 51 “impulit audax Ut versus facerem.''

17. elea] Ast damia or Hippolyte, the wife of AcastuS, king of Iolcos»,
out of revenge for his rejection of her, induced her husband to expose Peleus
to destruction by wild beasts on Mount Pelion, where he took him to hunt,
and left him asleep without his swerd. Hippolyte is called ‘Magnessam’
peffiiuse Iolcos was in Magnesia. Joseph’s virtue has its parallels iu Grecian
a e. ,

19. peccare docentes] ‘ inciting to sin.’

20. Fallax historias movet] ‘ Mentionem movere ' occurs in Livy3 ‘ cantus
movere ' in Virgi13 ‘ carmen movere ² in Ovid. ‘ Historias movere ’ is there-
fore a legitimate expression3 ‘ brings up‚' ‘ calls to his mind.’

21 Frustra:] A complete and very comprehensive sentence. It occurs
below (C. 13. 6). Some persons join the word on with the last line, which
wcakcns its force. Icari is the Icarium Mare, that part of the AEgean which
washes the coast of Caria. With these words compare Euripides (Med. 28),

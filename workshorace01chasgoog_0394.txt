EPODE 1.

Wmm Augustus had determined on the expedition against M. Antonius*
and Cleo atra, which led to the battle of Aetium, Β. e. 31, he summoned, as
we leam m Dion Cassius (50. ll), the leading senators and men of Eques-
trian rank to meet him at Brundisium, for the benefit of their counsel‚ and
(the historian says> to keep the Equestrians from mischief, and also to show
the world the harmony to which he had brou ht men of all orders at Rome.
Maecenas obeyed this summonS, and went to tundisium‚ but was sent back
by Augustus to watch over the peace of the city and the affairs of Italy. It
is ve possible that Maecenas may have had the offer of a command on the
expe 'tion against M. Antonius, and that both he and Horace believed he
was ing on that service, until, on his arrival at Brundisium, Augustus
·th0ug t fit to send him back to discharge more important duties at Rome.
Horace, supposing him to be going, wished to accompany him, but Maecenas,
would not allow it (v. 7), which gave ,occasion for this Epode. It is an
affectionate remonstranee against bemg left behind.

used by the iburnians, a. piratical tribe on the Illyrian coast. Augustus

serpent's stealthy coming more if she leave them, though not likely to help

338 nome.

Annonem. — Faunus, come with mercy to my fields, und deperi: gentle
to my young lambs, for Ι sacrifice and pour libatione to thee at the sall of the
year. When thy Nones come round, the old altar smokes with incense 3 the
floeks sport in safety, the oxen are ut rest, und the village is gay; the wood
sheds its leaves, and the clown smites his enemy, the earth, in the danee.

3. incedas abeasque] Faunus was not a stationary divinity. He was sup-

poslgd to clpeme iF the spring, ang dgffirt ἲζιγΐξαεῐιὲιὲῑιοεΠερΙεῑὶἒῇιέιῑῐίἰί,τὲ gagissvggbfflssl 1

5. Si tener pleno cadit haedus annm] ‘ 1f a young kid is offered in sacrifice ,
at the end of the ycar'3 when the Faunaliu took place. Horace claims the
protection of Faunus for his lambe in the spring, on the ground of his due
observance of the rites of December, which he then goes on to describe:
Horace here makes the wine-cup the companion of VenuS, as he made ‘Jo-
cus' in O. i. 2. 34. See also C. i. 30. 5, q. He uses both foi-tm, ‘crater'
und ⁴ cmterm’ ‘ Vetus ura’ may be an ol altar Horace found on his sarm
when he came into possession of it. *

13. audaces] ‘ fearleSS,’ on account ‘of the presence of FaunuS.

14. Sparyit — frondes ,·] It does not quite appear why the wood should be
said to shed its leaves in honor os Faunus: it may bein sorrow sor his ‹le-
pax-ture, or as a carpet for him to tread upon, or for his worshippers to defice 1
upon.

16. Ter] ‘ Ter' expresses the triple time of the dunce, from which is
derived the verb ‘tripudiare’ ‘Fossor' is put generally, I imagine, sor a n
, labor-ing husbandmen, who may be supposed to have no love sor the earth ³

that he digs for another. ·

oDE xlx.

Tim impetuosity and liveliness of this Ode are remarkable. The occasion
for which it was composed was a supper in honor of Murena'n installation in
the college of augure. In regard to this person see C. ii. 2 and 10. Tele-
phus is no doubt a fictitions nume. It occurs in two other Odes (i, 13 and
iv. 11. 21), and efforts have been made to prove the person to be the same
{in euch case. Fut there is no resemblance. All the names at the eud are

ctitious.

SATIRE 1.

C. 'Passurus Tuan was a jurisconsult of eminence, and a man of honor.
He was in the confidence of Augustus, and was consulted b him on legal
matters. Horace seems to have been well acquainted with im, though he
waflffi gaagnyigffiiggegjthsseffoffeoetzaetssffi law er a case for his opinion, and
asks what he had better do to meet the malevo enee of his enemies. Trebatius
advises him to cease from writing, which Horace says is impossible. He was
born to write, and must do it. He has no capacity for heroic subjects, and
has a passion for imitating Lucilius, to whom he pays a graceful compliment
by the way. Trebatius warns him that he runs the risk of being frozen to
death by his great friendS, or of legal penalties for libel. But, trusting in the
goodncss of his cause, he sets these dangers at defiauee, and resolves to in-
dulge his inclination.

1. Sunt quibus—videor] Horace had undoubtedly in his mind those ar-
ticular opponents, on some of whom he had retorted in S. 10 of the last
boolt, and, this being the case, the indicative mood is wanted, rather than the

means ‘without vigor! As to ‘ deduci, see S. i. 10. 44, n.

3. {primiti erusff] 1ῃὲἓέαὲ cl'ielow (v. 16) the imperfect indicative is used
where the subjunctive might be expected. The Greeks in similar cases some-

times used the imperfect indicative without ἅν, where the usual construction
uired that word.
er uncti Transmonte Tiberim] See S. i. 6. 123, n. The language is a
little in the style of a ‘lex.' ‘ Sub noctem ’ means immediately after night-
fall. See Epod. ii. 44, n. S. ii. 7. 109. Epp. ii. 2. 169. It appears from
Cicero’s letters to Trebatius that he was a great swimmer, and Cicero deo
scribes himself as having gone home from his house one night “ bene potus
seroque '’ (Ad Fam. vii. 22). He may therefore have lived pretty freely.
10. rapit] There is force in this word, ‘ hurries you on like a torrent?

13. quivis] This corresponds to ὁ τυχών in Greek.

14. fincta pereuntes cmpide] Plutarch, in his Life of Marius (c. 25), re-
lates honr, on the occasion of a battle with the Cimbri, he altered the spears
of the soldiers in such a way that· they could not be of use to the enemy. He
says that the spear-heads were formerly fastened to the shaft by two iron
nails, and that Marius, removmg one, substituted for it a wooden peg, which
would give way when the spear stmck the shield, where it would stick and
drag along the ground. From the year B. c. 39 to 31, Augustus was cn-
gaged at different times in subduing the Garris, and he included his victories
over them in the first of his three days' triumphe, in B. c. 29. (See C. i. 2.

80. Οωιιιείηί more &linquis 9] As to Canusium, see S. 5. 91. It was one
of those Greek towns which remained lon st and most purely the language
of its founderS, as we may suppose from t e text.

36. Tur-‚qim Alpinus] This is supposed to be a bad poet named Μ. Fu-
rius Bibaculus, born at Cremona B. c. 102. ‘ Turgidus ’ refers to his person.
Horace describes him elsewhere as “ pingui tentus omaso ’' (S. ii. 5. 40),
where a bombastie verse of his is quoted, which may aecou'nt for his being
called familiarly, by his contemporaries, Alpinus. Horace speaks of his mur-
dering Memnon, and it is general-ly supposed that this refers to a translation
he made of t-he Aethiopis of Aretinus, one of the Cyclie poets, in which
Memnon was one of the principal heroes.

37. Definyit Rloem· luteum camb] Hor-aee says that Furius, like some rude
artist, had made a. figure of Rhenus (the Rhine) with a head of clay, referring
to the statues by which the different river-gods were represented, and to some
description this poet had given of the Rhine, perhaps m a poem he is said to
ihiavle t‘wi-ittet}i on ,the Gallie war. ‘ Defingo is ‘ to fashion out,’ and differs

38. Quae πεξιῗε in aede ment] Sp. Maecius Tarpa was the officer who
licensed plays before they were acted. He is mentioned again in the Ars
Poetica (v. 387). His duties had reviously formed part of the functions of
the aediles, and it was not till po itical allusione became common, and the
position of affairs too critical to bear them, that this special censorship was
created. ‘Aedes ’ in the singular signifies ⁴ a temple! Temple-s of Apollo and
the Muses are referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 37) as the nesortof poets, and
other temples besides (sec Ovid. Trist. iii. 1. 69) had buildings attached where
men of letters assembled. In one of these, therefore, or some building espe-
cially consecrated to the MuseS, poets who had plarfs they wished to get rep-
resented recited them, robably in the presence of arpa.

42. Unus vivorum, diadum, ς] Of this Fundanius, who Horace says was
the only man of the day who could write a comedy in the style >of Menander
’ and that school, nothing whatever is known. He is the narrator of the scene
in S. ii. 8, the supper of Nasidienus. Probably Horace exaggerated his mer-
itS, as well as Pollio’s, out of affection for the men. As to Pollio, see C. ii. l,
lnt, and v.10, n. ‘Regum,' such as the “sacra Pelopis domus '² (C. i. 6.
8, n.). ‘ Pede ter percusso ’ refers to the trimeter iambic, the common meas-
ure of tragedy. ·

44. Ut nemo Varius ducit ‚·] As to Varius, see the ode last mentioned, vv.
8, ll, and S. 5. 40. The derived signifi-cationes of ‘ducere’ are various. As

«we have no reason to suppose that Vir-gil was classed by his contemporaries
with poets of the first rank. ‘ Facetum ’ signifies ‘ elegant,' as in a. coxcomb
it would be called ‘ fine,' S. 2. 26.

Varrone Atacino] P. Terentius Varro was a poet os the ᾶαῑ some ears
older than Horace. He was called Atacinus from the Atax, β river of allia

name of Raetiae, Raetia Prima or Proper, and Secunda, which embraced the “

possessions of the Vindelici: these also compriscd several other trich, of
whom Horace particularly mentions the Genauni and Breuni. The whole of
this war took place in the spring and summer of the year B. c. 15, and we are
led to suppose from C. iv. 14. 34 - 38, that it was brought to a conclusion in
the month of August, on the anniversary of the capture of Alexandria by
Augustus in the year 30 (C. i. 37, Introduction). In honor of these victorics
Horace composcd this Ode and the fourteenth of this book, the one more

other was composed two years aftenvardS‚ when Augustus returned to Rome.

The brave give birth to the brave. The steer und the horse have the blood
of their sires, and the engle gives not birth to the dove. But education brings
out the seeds of virtue. What Rome owes to thc Nerones let the Metums
witness, and the day which saw Hasdrubal defeated, and drove the clouds and
the fierce African from Latium. Our strength grew and our gods returned
from that dav, and Hannibal was forced to cry, “As the deer might pursue

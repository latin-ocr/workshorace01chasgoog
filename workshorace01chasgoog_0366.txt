stellation Canis Minor, and called ‘ Ante Canem ' by a litei-al version of the
Greek name, rises about the same time, and the sun enters Leo : see above,
. C. iii. 1¹3. 8, n. ‘ Stella ' is not commonly put for ‘ siduS,' the constellation,
as it is iere.

25. Tu civitatem] See Introduction. As to ‘ regnata,’ see C. ii. 6 ll.
The Seres represent indefinitely the sarthest Eastern nations known to the
Romans (see C. i. 12. 56). The Bactrians were formerly part of the Per-
sian ernpire, and were at this time partly subject to the Parthians and
partly to a Scythian racc, the Tochari, Baetra was their capital. The mean-
ing of Horace ie, that Maecenas should not trouble himself about improbable
dan ers,

35. aequore] ‘ Aequore ’ is equivalent to ‘ alveo,’ the channe-l of the river.
'Virgil has “ viridesque secant placido aequore silvas '’ (Aen. viii. 96). The
next line describes well the quiet flow of a river.

43. cras vel atra] Compare C. ii. 10. 15. On ⁸ diffinget,’ see C. i. 35. 39.
‘ Vexit’ is employed unusually for ‘ avexit!

49. Fortuna saei-o] The caprice of Fortune, represented as ’ a eoquette
transferring her favors from one favorite to another, and delighting to trifle
with the happiness of men, is the lowest Epicurean view of life and the
world's government. But Horace writes conventionally. He has just as·
signed to the Father of all the ordering of mcn’s liveS.

51. Transmutat incertos honores,] Compare C. i. 34. 12, sqq.

53. si celeres quatit] Horace uses ‘ si ’ where other writers would use ‘ sin?

54. resiqno] This is equivalent to ‘ rescribo' in a money sense, ‘ to pay
back? ‘ Mea virtute me involvo ’ is a picture of sels-satisfaction. The man

with him, and unites himself to overty, as to a bride without a portion.

60. Cypriae Tyriaeque mercesll' Cyprus abounded in copper and other
metals, including gold and silver, together with precious stenes. It exported
wines also and oil. The trade of Phoenicia, which at this time formed part
of the Roman province of Syria, was carried on through Sidon more largely
than T re, which, however, was a port of some consequence under the emper·
ors. orace is speaking generally, and ‘ Tyriae merces ’ answered his pur-
pose as well as any other expression.

not so used elsewhere, but for two banks of ears. - ”

64. seret] See above, C. iii. 9. 12, ιι. ‘ Geminasque Pollux ’ is an ellip-
tieal way of expressing. ⁸ Pollux cum gemino fratre! See C. i. 3. 2.

ODE XXX.

Tms Ode appears to have been written as an epilogue to the first three
books, as C. i. 1 was the prolog-ue. It expresses the conviction, which time
has justified, that, through his Odes, Horace had achieved an immortal name.
The same just pride had been shown by poets before him 3 as by Sappho, in
a poem of which the first line only has been preserved, μνάσασθαί τινά

μι καὶ ὕστερον ἀμμέων (16 Bergk); and by Ennius, in the lines (see

.ii. 20. 21, n.), —

“ Nemo me lacrimis decoret nec funera fletu
Faxit. Cur? volito vivu’ per ora virum,''
which words Virgil has made his own (Georg. iii. 9). Propertius (iii. 1),
Ovid (Met. xv. 871, sqq.)‚ and Martial (x. 2. 7, sqq.) have all imitated.
Horace very closely.

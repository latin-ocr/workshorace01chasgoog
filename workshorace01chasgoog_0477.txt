41. Primum nam inquiram] ⁴ Nam ' is sometimes used to introduce an ex·
planation, as here and in Epp. i. 1. 76. Compare Caesar (B. G.·iii. 28) :

their name. The Stoice admitted no mean between perfect wisdom, or virtue,
and absolute folly, or viee. The fool, therefore, was a madman, and he was
a fool who was ignorant of the truth: and this maxim (‘formula’) applies to
all men except the sage; the sage, therefore, is he who is perfectly aequainted
with the nuth, which is the Stoics’ equivalent for a virtuous man. This
theory of virtue led to the doctrine of punishments ridiculed by Horace iu the
third Satire of the first book. The Stoice allowed no tions of virtue,
and therefore admitted no gradatione of punishment. heir notion of a sage

Est yenus unum] This is the first class of fools, those who are afraid where

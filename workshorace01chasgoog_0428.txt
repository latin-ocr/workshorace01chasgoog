127. Chrysippus ‹licon-J The later Stoics looked to Chrysippus as the
founder of their philosophy3 but he justified, with little essential deviation,
to the doctrines taught him by his master CleantheS, and Cleanthes was a ‹le-
voted disciple of Zeno. He was born at a town in Cilicia, B. c. 280, and was
a vel voluminous writer. ‘ Inquit ’ means that some Stoie says this, includ-
,in m ‘non nosti’ to ‘sapiens‚’ and after ‘quii' to ‘sie.rex'.(·v. 133).

to exet-eise aut ority‚ as an artisan or a singer may still be great in his cau-
· ing, even when he has laid asido the practice of it.

death is mentioned in the second Satn-e, and whose ¹chartreter is described at
the beginning of this. Hermogenes is also called Tigellius in S„ 4, 72 3 10.
80, 90. But as he is always spoken of as alive, it is impossible he can be
Tigellius the Sardiniam to whom there are no grounds for giving2Qe name
Hermogenes, though the Scholiasts ’ve it him. HermogenesTigellins was
a teaeher of music (S. 10.·9o), and whether ironically or not-it is not easy

25. vanis rerum,] bec C. iv. 12. 19, 11.

28. Oocto num adest] The ‘ m ' is pronouneed with the following word, as
is common in Terence. -

30. deceptum te petere. ἶ] The infinitivo ‘petere ' expresses a feeling of in-
dignation. This infinitive is dependent on some such phrase as ‘ credendum
est.’ The sense is as follows: ‘⁴ To think that, although in the ualitv of
the flesh there is no distel-enee, you should prefer the pea-fowl to t e other,
deludcd b the superioritv of its heaut .’† ‘ Hac’ refers not to the bird last
mentioned: but to that which the spe er preferS, or 13 defendIng ; just as we
have ‘ his ' and ‘illis ' chan ing places below (36. 37).

31. Unde clatum sentis] ffPhe sentence goes on thus: (136 it so: grant that

Tiber or in the open sea, between the bridgcs or 31, 1116 mouth of the river? '’
This is not. a very well chosen question. That art of the river which is
meant by ‘inter pontes ' lay between the Pons 3111161113, which joined the
Insula Tiberina with the left bank, and the Pons sublicius, and between
these bridges the Cloaca Maxima emptied itself. Here the stream· was more
than usually rapid‚ and ‘jactatuS,’ ‘tossed,' expresses this. It would not

33. Ostia aab ι’ἵ] ‘ Sub ' with the accusative, in phrases of place, seems
to bave the meaning it has in phrases of time, ‘immediately aster (see Epod.
11. 44,- 11.) ;. 30 that ‘sub ostia ' would be ‘immediately on entering the mouth?
But it usually in these phrases follows a verb of motion, and means ‘ close up
to ’; and if 11 be so understood here, the verb· of motion must be supplied5
‘as you approach close u ·o.’ The Tiber is called ⁴ Tuscus amnis‚' as (O.
¹‘if¹3 20. 5) it 13 said to be Rlaeecnas’s ‘paternum flumen‚' because it rises in

tmria.

34. Mallum] The mullet was a fish in high estimat-ion for a great number
of years. Martial speaks of one of two pounds as the least that should be
put upon a fine dish. This, Plin sayS, was a size it rarely exceeded. Ju-
venaltells a story of a man who *ought a mullet of six 1101111113, at a thou-
sand sesterces for each pound (iv. 15). The beai-ded mullet, as it was called,
was held in highest 63166111. Horace says the man is mad to admira a mullet
of three 1101111113, since to be served up it must. be divided into 33 many sepa-
rate 11131163(366 Ε ,1. 18. 48, 11.).

36. Quia seilicet ' is] ‘ Illis ’ does not refer to the more remote object here,
but te the nearer, as in v. 29 (see note). ‘ His ’ refers to the mullet.

40. At voe, Pmeaeentes Austri‚] ‘ Now may ye‚ Ο potent south-winde!
‘ At’ 13 a particle os exclamation, when a sudden emotion is expressed‚ as
mentioned above (mpod. v. 1). The winds are invoked as 11611163. Α3 10

the fresh tut-bot 1036 their ssavor, when the stomaeh 13 gorged 31111 seeks stun-
ulants!

42. rhombus} This 11311, if it was 1116 narbet, was 1101, less esteemed· by the
Romans than by ourselves. The finest were caught in the Hadriane, 11631·
Ravenna, whence the fish that caused such a sensatim) in Juvenal’s story (w.-
3-7, sqq.) he calls “ Hadriaci spatium admirabile rhombi? But ,it is not cer:

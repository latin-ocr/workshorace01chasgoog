particular order of seasons is observpgd, but one recreation after anothe’r is
mentioned as it occurs.
·15. ampliaria] These vessels were used for keeping honey, as well au
Μῗὲ. infirmas This is no more than an ornamenta] epithet. “
17. Vel cum ⁴ Vel' has here a copulative force, and not a disjunctive, as
“ Silvius Aeneas pariter pietate vel armis Egregius '² (Aen. vi. 769). ‘Et'
would have made the sentence too much of a climax, especially with the ex-
clamation ‘ ut gaudet!

19. qaudet —decerpensJ This is after the Greek idiom δρέπων ἥδεται.

21 . Priape,1 This was one of the inferior order of divinities, only acknowl-
edged as such in later times. He was accordingly treated with contempt
sometimes, as in S. i. 8. He presided over gai-dene, protected flocks‚ and
generali was worshipped in connection with the pursuits of husbaudry.

22. ilvane, tutor finium .' Silvanus here onl is called the protector of
boundariae, which province longed to the god erminus. Virgil calls him
the god of corn-fields and cattle (Aen. viii. 601); but, as his name implies‚ he
was chiefly connected with woods and plantations.

24. tenaci] This is merely a redundant epithet. Graes, especially short
turf grass, which is here meant, binds the soil and tenaciously adhenes to it,
both of which ideas seem to be included in this word.

b 2{. interim] As we say, ‘ the while? ‘Altis ripis’ are roeky‚ overhanging
an s.

27. lymphis obstrepunt] ‘ Obstrepunt ’ is used absolutely, as in C. iii. 30. 10.
‘Lymphis ' is the ablativo absolute.

28. Somnos qnod invitet] Compare Virg. (1301. i. 56): “ Saepe levi som·
num suadebit inire susurro.'’

29. annus} This is used for the season of the year, as in Virgil (Ecl. iii.
5⁷), “ formosissimus annus.”

31. Aut trudit acres] The hunters encompassed some large space (gen-
erally the scot of a wooded hill) with strong nets, which they gradually drew
into a more and more nan-ow circle, while dogs and beaters with tort-hes were
set to drive the beasts into a given spot, where they were attacked and slain;
or else they were driven down to the nete, with which they were entangled or
stopped‚ unless they contrived, as they sometimes did, to break through them,
which would give occasion for a cliase in the open plain (sec C. i. l. 28).
Plutarch, in his life of Alexander, speaks of toils twelve miles long. The
puers, Latin and Greek, used the feminine gender in speaking of hunting-
dogs, as mares are more often mentioned than horsea sor the tace. ‘ Amites '
were forked stakes ou which the nets were stretched. ‘ Plagae ' were the
strong nets mentioned above; ‘ retia ' were finer ones for birds and fish; ‘retia
rara ' were those with wider meshes than fishing-nets‚ and therefore used only
for birds. ‘ Edacibus ' represents their depredatione on the corn. ‘Laqueo ’
may be pronounced as a dissyllable.

39. in partem] ‘ on her part! The Greeks said ἐν 'pen

41. Βιώίηα] Sec C. iii. 6. 37, n. Horace is fond effluoducing his Sabine
and Apulian friends, See C. iii. 5. 9, n.

42. Pernicis] ‘ Pernix' signifies patient, steadfast, being compounded of
‘ per ' and ‘ nitor.’ When ap lied to motion, it comes to mean swift-‚ by the
natural consequence of a steinip movement of the wings or feet, which accom-

plishes distance more rapidly than irregular speed.

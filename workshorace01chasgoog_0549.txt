or thou for theim, may Jove ever doubtful kee ‚ he who es over both
thee and Rome! The meaning of this is, ‘ y thy country ever care for
thee, and thou for thy coun , with anequal affection!

31. Nempe Vir ὁοηω] Quintius is supposed to answer‚ ‘ Yes‚ surely, 1
like to be ealled good and wise, and so do you! ⁸ Nay,’ re lies Horace,
‘ such praise as this is given one day, and may be withdrawu next; and

40. Vir bonu est quin] The answer is to this effect: “ In the eyes of the
people the good man is he who never transgresses the laws; who is seen act-
ing as ‘judex ' in important canses, and has never been known to be corrupt;
whom men choose as their sponsor, and whose testimony carries weight iu
ωσι-ις but all the while the man’s own neighborhood and family may know
him to be foul within, though fair enough without.”

41. Qui munden ,J of the component parts of the Roman civil law
Horace mentions ree. ‘Jura ’ signifies legal rights and rules of law. It
has the latter meaning here. ‘ Leges? properly so called, were laws passed
in the ‘comitia centuriata.’ They were first ap roved by the senate, and
then mposed to the comitia by a magistratus o senatorial rank. ‘ Plebis-

they had tffigrce gf leges. ‘ Senatus-corgnitu ’ (‘'consult'a patrum ') appear,
,in some instamus, to have had the force of law during the re ublic3 under
the empire, they superseded the legislation os the comitia. oraoe might
have added other parts of law, and more particularly ‘ mores‚' which were au
those laws that sprung from immemorial usage.

42. secantur] See S. i. 10. 15. ιι. ‘Teneress in the sense of gaining a.
cause, is not common. It is used by Cicero (Pro Caecina, c. 24) : ‘⁴ Scaevola
causam apud centumviros non tenuit.''

43. Quo res sponsore] See S. ii. 6. 23, ιι. Horace means a man whose
credit is good as a sponsor and a witness.

46. Nsesmumfoei There are some who think themselves very good,
who would be bad i they dared. To such a one Horace answers as he an-
swemd his slave, when he boasted of his goodness. Vv. 46-56 are a dia-
logue between the slave and his masten the application, being easily made,
is not expressed. Not to be very wicked does not make a man good; noris
it sufficient to abstain from crime through sear of punishment: our motivo
should be the love of virtue for her own sake. ‘ Sabellus ’ may mean the
‘villicus,' or it may be taken for any plain-judging man. Man suppose
Horace means himself. Orelli does so. ‘Frugi ' is explained on . ii. 5. 77.

57. Vir ὀοηιιε, omnesorum] He whom the people believe to be , whom
everybody turns to look at as he walks through the Forum, and ooks up to
when he speaks in the murts. ‘⁴ Gaude quod spectant oculi te mille loquen-
tem.'' (Epp. 6. 19.) There were three principal ‘fora’ in Rome, in which

the erection of another, ad'oining the Forum Romanum, and it was called
after him. It was finished y Augustus. Afterwards Augustus built a small
forum in the same neighborhood, wherein none but judicial business was
transacted. It was partially destroyed by fire, and restored by Hadrian.
Other ‘ fora' were asterwards erected by different emperors (Nerva, Trajan,
Vespasian). In every ‘ forum ' there was a ‘basilica (or more than one), a

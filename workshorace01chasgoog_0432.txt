42. Sarma» pmpivrae] ‘ Sermoni ' means common conversation. Hence
the name ‘ Sermones ' given ω the Satires and Epistles.

43. os Mayna sumturum] This form does not appear elsewhere iu this
word. Cicero uses ‘praestatur-us: and Sall. (Jug. 47) ‘juvaturus' Horace
has ‘intonata' in Epod. ii. 51. See Vis-g. Georg. iii. 294): “Nunc vene-
randa Pales, magno nunc ore sonandum.” he attributes of a poet, which
Horace considers essential, are genius, inspira-tion, and dignified sentimenta,
and l suited to high subjects.

45. ⁸ quidam] ‘ In reference to this, certain persons have raised the
question whether a eomedy was or was not a poem ’ : “ utrum comoedia esset
poema necne oesetl' This is a giemmarian’s question, and depends upon
the definition assumed for a poem, in which, however, imagination is gen·
erally su posed to have a conspicuous place, and this would exclude the com-
edies of Blautus and Terence, and their Greek originale of the New Comedy,
from the title of poetry. But the same rule would exclude much more that
has passed for try, with less pretension to the name even than Horaee's
Staglres, 0ᾌέιὲ eautontimorumenos. ‘ Quidam’ signifies the grammar-iane

ropides are instanees m point. ‘ At,' which usually in such places introduces
anobjection, here seems to be the remark of one who supposed that the fui-y
anu ranting of the enraged father in the comedy might be supposed to par·-
take of the fire of poetry. But Horace disposes of the objection very easily.
Any father who had such a son as Pomponius, for instance, a dissolute youth
(of whom we know nothing more), would probably storm at him in much the
same terms that the man on the stage uses. It was the aim of the New
Comedy, which the Roman writers followed, to put real life upon the stage
by means of a plot natural and probable, and to represent men and women
as they were seen and heard every day, in which it differed essentially from
the Old Comedy, a mere vehicle for political and personal satire.

“ Si quae laboriosa est ad me curritur:
Si lenis est ad alium defertur gregem.
In hac est pura oratio.'’
So Cicero (In Verr. ii. 4. 22) s eaks of “ purum argentum,” plats with the
ornamental work taken off. c says it is not enough (to constitute a poem)
that it should be written throughout in plain langua , which, if you take to
pisces, it will be found that any father in common 1· e expresses his wrath in

the same tei-ms as the father in the play.

56. His ayo quae nunc,] ‘ From these verses that 1 now write and Lucilius
wrote formerly, if you take away certain times and measures (measures reg-
ulated by beating time), and change the position of the words, you will not
(as you would if you broke up such a verse as the following, Postquam, etc.)
find the members of the poot thus torn to pieces.' That is, his language
would be unintelligible, or there would be no more of the poet left. ·

their notions on the subject were very confuse apparently. According to
the name (which involves the same element as γέν-εσις, 'yn—nopae), it should
be the attendant on a man’s birth, as it was believed to be the inseparable

speaks of “genium memorem brevis aevi '' (Epp. ii. 1. 143), and offerings of
wine and flowers, and such like, were said to be resented to the genius when
a man was indulging in that way himself (A. EI) 209). This ex laius the
expressions “genio indulgere ’' (Persius v. 151), “ genium suum d raudare ”
(Terence, Phor-m. i. 1. 10), “genium curare '' (C. iii. 17. 14). Women had

EPISTLE VIII.

Rnsrnorme the person to whom this Epistle was written, and the occa-
sion, see Ep. 3 of this Book, Introduction, and note on v. 15. Horace, it
appcam, was not in ve good humor with himself when he wrote it. He
describes himself as su ering less from bodily than mental weakness, irrita-
bility, slug ishness, perverseness, and caprice. He may use rather sti-onger
language an was necessary, but there can be no doubt he felt a good deal
of what he says he felt. It shows that a man may give good advice to his
friends which he cannot steadily apply to himself, and it hclps us to under-
stand the character of Horace, and his philosophical aspirations, described,
probably about this time, iu his Epistle to Maecenas (i. 1).

2. comiti scribaeque Neronis] See S. i. 7. 23, n. The following words in
this Epistle have been referred to in former notes: ‘ quid agam ’ (Epp. 3. 15),
‘minantem' (S. ii. 3. 9), ‘momorderit' (S. ii. 6. 45), ‘cur’ (C. i. 33. 3), ‘co-
horti’ (S. i. 7. 23). ‘ Suaviter' occurs in the same connection in S. i. 9. 5.
‘ Multa et ulchra minantem ' refers to his philosophical aspirations aud pro-
fessions. ee Introduction.

6. Ionyt'nquis armentum aeyrotet in aar-is ς] The pastures of Apulia, Calabria,
and Lucania, and those of the basin of the Po, have been referred to before
(C. iii. 16. 35; Epod. i. 27).

10. properent aroere veter-²205] As to the construction, see C. i. 27. 4, ιι.
‘ Veternus ’ is a lethargy, here applied to the mind, and his faithful physicians
are the friends who would cheer and rouse him, though we may take the
word ' medicis ’ literally, and suppose he was under medical treatment. His
feelings probably arose out of the state of his health.

14. Ue placeat juveni] Tiberius was now in his twenty-third year. But on

‚‘juvenis,’ see C. i. 2.- 41. ἱ

 

EPISTLE IX.

As to SeptimiuS‚ on whose behalf this letter of introduction is addressqd t:
Tiberius, see C. ii. 6, Introduction. The occasion was that journcy into Ar-
menia which has been referred to twice before (Epp. 3 and 7). Itis a well-
considered and eareful production. Horace would have written more warmly

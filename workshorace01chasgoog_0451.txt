SATIRE VII.

Tun subject of this Satira is a disputo between Rupilius Rex, one of the
officers on the staff of Brutus, and a merchant named PersiuS, of Clazomenae
(a town on the gulf of Smyrna), arising, it may be supposed, out of some
money transactione. Horace treats the matter much in the same way as the
dispute got up between the two parasites for the amusement of Maecenas and
his friends at Caudium (S. 5. 51, sqq.). He no doubt had some reason for
disliking Rupilius, which the Scholiasts supply, whether with any sufficient
authority it is impossible to say. They tell us that this man’s native place
was Praeneste (which ma be gathered from v. 28„ that he was banished
from that town by his fel ow-eitizens; that he ‘then ser-ved in Africa in the

proscribed by the Triumvirs, and joined the army of Brutus. Finally, that he
was disgusted at Horace, a man of low birth, being made a military tribune,
and continnally insulted him, which indignities Horace retorted in this Satine.
PersiuS‚ the Scholiasts say, was born of a Greek father and a Roman mother.
Beyond this, which may or may not be true, we know nothing about him bnt
what we gather from this Satire, that he was a wealthy man, and carried on
a large business of some kind at Clazomenoe. The dispute arose when Bru-
tus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in n. c. 43-44 (see note on
v. 18). How soon afterwards the Satire was written, it is impossible to say ;

1. Proscripti Reyis Rupili] The Rupilia gens was a plebeian family of no

at note in Rome. The only one of the name who was distinguished was
&Rupilius consul in B. c. 132, aud the following year roconsul in Sicily.
He was the intimate friend of Laelius and the Younger cipio (Cic. de Anii-
cit. 27). As to Rupilius Rex and PersiuS, sce Introduction. By ‘proscripti ’
it is per-ha s intended to compare this Rex with the last of the RegeS, Tar-
quinius. 1I't' so, the play upon the name is repeated in the last line. See
note.

2. Hybrida quo pacto sit Persius ultus,] ‘ Hybrida' applies to all cross-bred
animals, and was used for a man one of whose parents was a Roman and the
other a forei er. .

3. Omnibugsnet lippis notum et tonsoribus] The apothecaries' and barbers’
shops were constantly crowded with idlers, who had nothin to do bnt to gos-
sip about the newshdssgm hour. With the lIJarbers it has {een so in all ages

7. Confidens tumidusque,] See C. iii. 4. 50, n.

8. Sisennae Barros ut equis] Of Sisenna and Barrus nothing is known3
but it may be conjectured, from this place, that their names were proverbial
for foul-mouthed, abusive persons. The plural number is used here for the
singular, according to a usage common to all languages. So Virg. Georg.
ii. 169 : “ Haec Decios, Marios, magnosque caminos, Scipiadas duros bello.''
Cic. Cat. Maj. 6: “ Fabricii Curii Coruncanii.'’ See also above, C. i. 12.
37, where Scauros is probably put for the best of that family, M. AEmilius.
‘ Equis albis ' is equivalent to ⁴ fleet horses,’ according to that line of Virgil
in which he describes the horses of Turnus, “ Qui candore nives anteirent,
cursibus auras ’' (Aen. xii. 84). The expression ‘ equis praecurreret albis ³ is
proverbial, ‘ he would soon outstrip them.’

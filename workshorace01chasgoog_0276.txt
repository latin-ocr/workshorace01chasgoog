ll, 12. Pontica pinu-sq The best shi timber came from Pontus. ‘ Pi· ⁴

ngsl' is in apposition with the subject ‘JaeteS,’ and ‘ nobilis ’ agrees wi
‘ i vae.²

15. nisi—Debes ludibrium] i. e. ‘ if thou be not fatcd to destruction.’

17. Nuper sollicitum] Taking the Ode as an address to the state, we can

›nly understand Horace to mean, that while he was attached to BrutuS, or

before he had received pandon, he had no other feelings than sear for his
own safety and disgust with the state of the country3 but now, under Au-
gustus, he watches its fate with the affection and anxiety of a friend. The
order is, ‘ (Tu) quae nuper eras mihi sollicitum taedium (et quae) Nune (es)

dffiildeiium curaque non levis, Vites aequora Interfusa (inter) nitentes Cy-
c as.

- ‘ 19. nitentes] This is like ‘fulgentes ’ (C. iii. 28.14), shining, as cliffs
will do m the sun. The Cyclades abound in white marble.

 

ODE XV.

Tuis is probably an early composition of Horace, made up of materials
from the Greek, and written merely to exercise his pen.

Ano-cumr. —Paris is carrying off Helen, when Nereus causes a calm,
and thus prophesies their fate ·. “ With dark omen art thou carrying home
her whom Greece hath sworn to recover. Alas for the sweating horse and
rider, and the deaths thou art bringing· upon Troy! Pallas prepareth her
arms and her fury. Under Venus’s shelter, comb thy locks and strike thy
lyre, and hide thyself in thy chambci·; but it shall not avail thee. Seest thou

iot Laertes's son, Nestor of P dos, Teucer οἷ’ SalamiS, and Sthenelus the
,ighter and bold charioteer2 erion too, and the son of Tydeus, from
‘thom thou shalt flce panting, as the stag flecth from the wolf, —thou‚ who
didst boast better things to thy fair one ’ἔ Achilles's wrath mav put off the
evil day, but the fire of the Greek shall consume the homes of Troy.

2. Helenen] Horace uses the Greek inflectione in his odes, and the Latin
in his iambic verscS, satireS, and epistles (Bentley). This might be expect-
ed, especially when, as in this instance, the imitation of Greek writers. is
obvious,

5. Nereus] He is made to speak, because the sea-gods were endowed with
the gift of Prophccy. ‘Mala avi’ is like “alite lugubri,’' C. iii. 3. 613
“ mala alite, ' Epod. tx. l..

7. Conjurata — rumpere] This is a legitimate prose construction. · “ Con·
juravere patriam incendere ” (Sal. Cat. 52. 24. See Liv. 22. 38). ‘ Rum-
pere ' governs ‘ regnum ⁸ ‚as well as ‘ nuptiaS,' though for its sense it ought
only to belong to ‘ nuptias! ,

11. aeqida} The ‘ aegis ’ was properly the skin of the goat Amalthea,
the nurse of Zeus, which he used as a shlcld or as a breastplate (see C. iii.
4. 57), where it is worn, as here, by Pallas. The word is not confincd in
use to the original meaning, but is taken for a mctal shield or breastplate
worn b Zeus, Pallas, or Apollo. It had a Gorgon's head upon it. =

13. eneri's praesidio] See Hom. Il. iii. 44, and on v. 16 see Il. iii. 3803
vi. 321. Horace's description of Paris is drawn, not from Homer, who
makes him brave, but from later writers who altered the Homeric characters,
See Heyne, Exe. i. Aen. ii. See also Aen. iv. 215, sqq.

14. I ecies caesariem] See C. iv. 9. 13.

15. divides ς] ‘ Dividere carmina' is perhaps to sing and play alternately.

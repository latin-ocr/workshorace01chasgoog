EPODE 11.

Honos, meaning to write on the praises of the country, put his poem into
the shape of a rhapsody by a money-getting! nemer, who, aster recitin the
blessings of a country life, and sighing sor e enjoyment of them, reso ving
to throw up his business, and persuading himself that he «letires nothing· so
much as retirement and a humble life, finds habit too strong br him, and
falls back up‘on the sordid pursuits which, after all, ane most con nial to
him. Thengh the, greater part of the speech mast be admitted to redier-
out of keeping with the su posed speaker, yet the pictme is very beautiful,
and the moral true. In the most sordid minds more genial impul-ses will

fioetion, and the picture of rustic enjoyment on the one hand, and of the Jaded
but still grasping πωπω* struggling for a micet against his propensities on
the other, offonis a wlnlesome lesson fm- nimy. ·

children, milk my gome, piepare m unbonght mcal, and no dfintics shall

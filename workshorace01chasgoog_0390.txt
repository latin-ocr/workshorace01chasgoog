THE SECULAR HYMN.

 

Wmm Augustus had eompleted the period of ten years for which the im..
perial power was at first placed in his hands (11.0. 27 - 17), 110 determined to
celebrate his successes at home and abroad by an extraordinary festival, and
he took as his model the Ludi Tarentini or Taurii, which had in former times
been obser-ved as a means of propitiating the infernal deitieS‚ Dis and Proser-

ina‚ on occasions of great public calamities. · It does not appear that this
estival ever was held at regular intervaIS. How, therefore, the name Ludi
Seculares arose, is not clear ; but, as it was now for the first time given, it
was probably convenient to have it believed that the games were no more
than the observance of a periodieal solemnity. The Quindecimviri were 01·-
dered to consult the Sibyllino books, and they reported, no doubt as they
were desired, that the time was come when this great national festival should
be repeated, and the details of it were laid down as from the commands of
the oracle in a set of hexameter Greek verseS‚ composcd of course for the oc·
casion, and which have been preserved to us by the historiam Zosimus ,’

Horace appears to‘havc been much plcased at being choscn poet-laureato,
of the occasion (sce C. iv. 6, Introd.). The Ode was sung at the most solemn
part of the festival, while the emperor was in person offering sacrifice at the
second hour of the night, on the river-side, upon three altana, attendcd by the
fifteen men who presidcd over religious uffan-S. The chorus consisted of
twenty-seven boys and twent ⁷·seven girls of noble birth, well trained no doubt
for the occasion (C. iv. 6). he effect must have been very beautiful, and no
wonder that the impression on Horaee's feclings (for in all probability he was
present) was strong and lasting.

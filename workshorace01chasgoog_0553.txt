52. Brundisium comes aut Sum-entant] To Brundisium a man might on
business; to Surrentum (Sor-rento) for the climate and scenery, whi are
still very hcalthy and beautiful. Surrentum was made a Roman colony
about this time. We do not hear much of it as a place of resort, though
from this passage we may infer that it was one of the pleasant spots on the
Campanian coast to which the wealthy Romans went for change of air. Its
wines were celebrated (see Epp. 15. 16, n.). In mentioning Brundisium,

59. Fracto mre lanum] The Romans adopted the Greek word πλάνος
for a vagabond amf impostor. As to ‘plurima‚' see C. i. 7. 8, n. Horace
makes the man swear by the Egyptian OsiriS, as if that were the most sacred
of oaths. Among other new superstitious, the worship of Isis had been
latcly introduced into Rome. Estorts were made, from time to time, to put
it down, and Augustus fot-bade its bein exercised in the city. -13ut under
later emperors it became established, wi thc encouragement of the govern
ment, in conjunction with that of Serapis. Osiris was not worshipped sep
rately‚ but shamd, perhaps, the reverence paid to his wife (Isis).

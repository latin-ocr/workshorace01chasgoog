sums. -- Boon 1. 445

98. Est brevitate apua] The want of this quality in Lucilius he condemns
in . 4. 9, s .
11. modo ῗὲειι] ‘ Tristi ’ signifies ‘serious'

12. Defendente vicem] ‘ Supporting the part‚’ like “fungar vice cotis '² (A.
P. 304), and “Actoris partes chorus officiumque virile Defendat'' (v. 193).
On ‘modo‚' see S. 3. 12. The combination Horace commentis is that of the
orator ste-aly or gravely rebuking vice, of the humorous satirist (‘ poetae ')
broadly fidiculing it, and of the ponshed wit, who, instead of throwing him·
sels with all his strength upon his victim, substitutos sarcasm for invective,
and lets his power be rather felt than seen. Of these three, the gravity of
stem reproof Horace estimares lowest, saying that ridicule generally settles
quemdem, of however grave importance, better and more decisively than se-
ven .

13 secat rea] ‘ Secare’ is used in the sense of ‘decidere' in Epp. i. 16.
42. Cicero (De Or. ii. 58) says, “Est'plane oratoris movere risum, -max-
ime quod tristitiam ac severum mitigat et relaxat odiosasque res saepe quas
argumentis dilui non facile est Joco risuque dissolvitss'

16. 1Πὶ scripta quibus] See S. 4. 2, n. ‘Hoc stabant,' ‘stood on this
ground,’ as ‘ hinc pendet,’ S. 4. 6.

18. Hermoyerzes] See S. 3. 129, n. ‘ Simius iste ' probably means Deme-
ttius, whom we meet with below (v. 79) as an abuser of Horace and (v. 90)
as a trainer of ‘mimae,' like Hermogenes, with whom he is associated. We
know nothing more of him. His only skill was to sing the love-songs of
glabras and Catullus, who were favorite poets of the last generatim, and great

'enda

20. verbis Graeca Latinis] This is a new fault in the style of Lucilius,
not be one mentioned. See the note on S. 4. 6.

21. Sen· studiorum] This phrase represents the Greek ὀψιμαθεῖς. In
‘ quine putetis ’ the interrogative enclitic is somewhat redundant, but not
mone than in man other instances, as S. ii. 2. 107, and 3. 295, 317.

22. Rhodio qu Pitholeonti] This person is unknown. His name prob-
ably was Pitholaus; if so, Horace changed that termination in conformity

with the Greek usage, as Τιμόλαος and Τιμόλεων, Μενέλαος and Μενέλεως,
&c.‚ are different forms of the same word.

24. ut Clu‘o noea si] On ‘nota ³ sce C. ii. 3. 8. Here the Chian, a sweet
wine, would representtthe Greek, as the rougher wine of Campania would
stand for the less polished Latin.

26. causa Petilli? See S. 4. 94, n.

27. Scilicet oblitus The sense of the passage from v. 25 to 30 is this:
“ You say that the language is more elegant if it be set off with Greek. But
1 ask you yourself, is it only when you are writing poetry‚ or when ou have
on hand a difficult cause, such as that of Petillius? Would you t en like-
wise, fot-getting your country and your birth, while our great orators Pedius
and Messalla are elaborating their speeches in their pure , mother tongue
(‘Latine ³),q— would you, 1 say, pnefer mixing up a foreign jargon with your
native lang-ua ‚ like a double-tongued man of Canusium ’.ἱ ” He puts the
composition o verses on such themes as Lucilius chose, on a level with the

gravity of forensic speaking, and asks why, if the man would not apply the
rule to the latter, he should do so to the former.

28. Oum Pedius causas] Who Pedius waS, is quite uncertain3 but he
must 'have been well known as an orator. It is also uncertain whether Pop-
licola belongs to Pedius or Coi-vium, about whom see C. iii. 21. ,Quintilian
describes him (x. 1. 113) as ‘⁶ orator nitidus et candidus et quodammodo prae
se ferens in dicendo nobilitatem suam.” And Horace speaks again of his
eloquence‚ A. P. 370. His intimacy with Horace began in the army of Bru-
tus, and continued unbmken till Horaee’s death.

120. Scriptor honoratum risorie reponis] ‘ Honoratus ' is only an ornamen-
tal epithet, corresponding to Homer's κλυτός, etc. ‘Reponis’ means ‘put
upon the stage again! The word is used in a different sense, v. 190: “Fa- -
bula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi.” ,

122. nihil non arrorzet ‹ze-mia] ‘ Let him claim everything for arms,' that is, ·
let him make arms his one appeal.

123. flebilis Ino,] There are several fragments remaining of a play by
Euripides bearing the name of Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, and wife of
Athamas, who threw herself into the sea with her son Melicerta, and. went
through various sorrows through the wrath of Here, and the rivalry of her
husband's other wives, Nephele and Themisto. She was worshipped after
her death as Leucothea, or Matuta Mater.

124. Perfidus Ixion, Io va9a‚] AEsehyluS, Sophocles, and Euripides each
wrote a tragedy entitled ‘ Ixion,’ of which fragments remain. See C. iii. 11.
21. The wanderings of Io, the daughter of Inachus, king of Argos, in the
form of a cow (whose passage across the struit that separatcs the Propontis
from the Euxine gave it the name of Bosporus), are related in many ways.
The most remarkable passage on this subject is contained in the Prometheus
of AEseh lus, in a scene in which she is herself introduced.

128. ajffi'ct'le est proprie conuertenda clzceret] ‘ Communia' means here what
everybody knOWS, or what is common property, as opposed to fictions of one's
own ereating, and ‘ proprie dicere ’ is to tell it so as to make it one's own.

131. Publica mater-les priorali juris ere't,] ‘ Public materials will become
private property.' Horace uses (without striet accuracy) tcrms which have
distinet legal significatione. ‘Proprie communia dicere, above, is the same
as making that which is ‘ publica materies ' ‘ privati juris? ‘ Communia’ is
usual in the sense of partnership property, and is different from ‘publiea'3
but here they have the same meaning. Horace seems to have followed a
Greek proverb, χαλεπὸν τὰ κοινὰ ἶδιῶσαι. As to ‘deducis,' see S. i. 1‘0.

132. vilem patulumque moraberis orbem] ‘ If you linger not about the vulgar
and wide round! What Horace means, is the hackneyed round of subjecte,
phrases, and illustrations, ground which anybody may tread, and many have
trod already. ‘Patulus’ is opposed to ‘arctus' (v. 133); the latter means
difficult‚ narrow ground, in which it is not easy to move except treading pre-
cis-ely in the steps of him whom you are following, ‘ out of w ich diffidence
or the plan of the work forbids you to advance,' that is, hampers your steps,
and prevento you from showin any originality.

136. ut scriptor cydicns olim .· A class of Epic poets arose some time after
Homer, who, perhaps from the habit ⁴of reeiting as rhapsodists the Iliad and
Odyssey‚ were led to adopting subjects akin to Homer’s, and connecting their
poems with his; and their design appear-ing to have been to form their poems
and Homer's into one cyclo, embracing the whole history of the Trojan times,
they came to be called by the grammarians Cyelic poets. Of these the oldest
was Aretinus of Miletus, whose poem was a continuation of the Iliad, and
nearly ‚as long. One of them, Lesches, a Lesbian contemporary with Archi-
lochus, wrote a poem known as the Μικρὰ Ἰλιάς. It opened 'with these two

lines, which Horace may or may not have had in mind:

Ἴλιον ἀείδω καὶ Δαρδανίην εὔπωλον,
ἧς πέρι πολλὰ πάθον Δαναοὶ θεράποντες *Apama
139. Par-tarium montes] ‘ Parturio ’ has the same relation to ‘ ario ' that

‘esurio ’ has to ‘ edo,' meaning the effert or desire to bring forth, t e being iu·
labor. Porphyrion quotes the proverb on which this and the sable that Phae-

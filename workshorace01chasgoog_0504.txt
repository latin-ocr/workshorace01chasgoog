the points he argues. Or he may have been giving Davus some good advice,
and he offers him 'a homily in return, recommending him to practise what he

mac-hes.
P 3. Mancipium] This word, which roperly signifies the act of taking pos-
session, ‘manu capiendo,’ is applied ere to the ‘res mancipi,' the object of
{Bnmfssighssm's’f which, in Sthi5s {7¹}Stanoe’ is a slave. It is so used in Epp. i. 6.

4. Ut vitale pugg-s] ‘ That you need not think him too good to live ' (S. 6.
82). As to the Saturnalia, see S. 3. 5, n. The month of December wan
dedicated to Saturnus. Horace speaks of the license of that festival being a
custom Ιὲαιιᾱοᾱ down from their ancestors. The time of its institution ,is

uite un nown.
q 6. Pars hominum] Davus avails himself, without preface, of his master-'s
pemission‚ and begins to moralize on the instability of some men, who never
know their own minds. This character he applies to his master in v. 23, sqq.

9. C'um tribus annellisfl This is mentioned as a large number. In later
times the Romans wore a great profusiori of rings on both hands. At this
time they were only worn on the left, because they were more likely to be in-
jured, and to be in the way, on the right hand. Priscus was a senator, and
therefore entitled to wear a gold ring, which privilege did not descend, at this
time, below the equestrian order. In later times it was confer-red upon all
manner of persons by the emperors. Those who were not entitled to wear
rings of gold had them of iron, according to the most ancient practice3 and
such of the Romans of higher condition as adhered to the simplicity of earlier
days continued to wear iron.

Priscus, as a senator, was entitled to go abroad with the ‘latus clavus,'
which he would do sometimes; while at others he would appear only asan
‘eques,’ with the ‘ angustus clavus? He was rich enough to live in a fine
house, and did so; but would from caprice go and take an obscure lodging‚
such as a poor man might be ashamed of. He put on first one character and
then another: now a man about town, and now talking of going to Athens
as a philosopher. He was just such an unstable person as Tigellius is de-
scribed to be, in S. i. 3. 18: “Nil fuit unquam Sic impar sibi.” He was
“ everything by turns, and nothing long.''

14. Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquia] Vertumnus, as his name indi-
cates, was the god who represented change. Horace says Priscus was born
when Vertumnus was angry (see S. 3. 8, n., “ Iratis natus paries dis atque
poetis ''), and he strengthens it by saying‚ ‘all the Vertumni that are to be

eund ‚’; as if every image of the god were a separate divinity, and all were

gout, which Horace says he richly deserved, and was so given to gambling
(which was illegal, see C. iii. 24. 58, n.), that, when he could not handle the
dice-box himself, he hired a boy to do it for him. ‘ Phimus’ was the Greek
word for what the Romans called ‘fritillas' From the shape it was also
called- ‘turricula ' or ‘ pyrgus ³ (πύργος). As to ‘talos,’ see S: 3. 171, n.
They were not always thrown from a box, but sometimes with the hand.

19. levius miser ac prior illm] ‘ Levius miser' is an unusual expression.
‘Prior illo ' means better off than that man who is always changing his
character, one moment appearing strict‚ another loose, in his principles and
conduct. The superiority of the man who is consistent in vice lies in his
indifference to virtue, and the quietness of his conscience arising from that
cause. In that sense he is better off, and less miserable, than the other.

21. Non dices hodia] ‘Hodie' is equivalent to ‘statim‚' ‘this moment!
‘Furcifer ' means a slave who for some slight offenoe was obl' d to go about
with a ‘ furca ’ round his neck, a sort of collar shaped like a , in which the

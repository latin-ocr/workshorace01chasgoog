stated after Caesar’s death, and made a military tribune Whethcr or no he
is different from the person mentioned below, v. 107, itis not easy to say,

25. fierique tribuno ?] Each legion in the Roman army (the number varied
at different times, but at Philippi there were nincteen on each side, each
le ’on consisting of about 6,000 men, rather less than more) had six tribunes
(ῖξὲ post Horace held in the army of Brutus), who were their principal
officere. The military tribunes of the first sour legions were entitled to sit in
the senate. (See Epod. iv. 15, n.) As to the ‘latus clavus,’ see note on the
34th verse of the last Satire. ‘ Quo‚' ‘to what purpose! (See C. ii. 2. 9, n.)

27. Nam ut qualeque insanus] The senators' ‘ ealceus,’ an out-door shoe,
was fastened by four thongs (‘ nigris pellibus '), two on each side, which went
aaa? sabaeas 111 ..1¹⁸er ses} .

30. quo morbo Barrus,] His discsse was a thirst sor admiration among
women. He was a man of bad passione, it is said. But we do not know
much about him. ι He need not be identified with the man in S. 4. 110. A
foul-mouthed person of the same name occurs in the next Satire (v. 8).

34. Sic qui promittit] This refers to ‚the promises of candidates for office,
and the three principal megisti-acics are implied: the city praetorship, in the
words ‘urbem sibi curae' ; the consulship, in ‘imperium et Italiam’ ; and ‚
the aedileship, in ‘delubra deorum‚' because it was the duty of the aedile to
attend to the temples and other public buildings,

38. Syri, Damae, aut Dionysi] These were common names of slaves.
The practice of executin criminals by throwing them from the Tarpeian
Rock (part of the Mons apitolinus) was not common in the latter period
of the republie. It was never applied to slaves, who were putto death,
chiefly by crucifixion‚ outside the city on the Esquiliae. (See Epod. v. 99, n).
Cadmus is said to have been a public executioner of that day.

40. At Novius] The upstart who is supposed to 116 addressed in the pre-
vious lines, is a plebeian tribune, and he here affirms that, if his birth is low,
that of his eolleague Novius (who may be anybody, sce note on S. 3. 21) is
still lower. Freedmen, and persons followin low trades, were admitted into
the senate, and forced into high magistracies {y Julius Caesar, and it was not
till some years after this Satire was written that Augustus purged the senate
of these members. The words ‘gradu post me sedet uno ' may be a metaphor
taken from the theatre, of which the first fourteen rows were assigned to the
Equites Epod. iv. 15, n.).

41 . oe tibi Paullus Et Messalla] These were names belonging to two of
the most distinguished families of Rome, ‘the AEmilia and Valeria. Horace
introduces the name Messalla probably out of compliment to his friend Cor·
vinus, for whom 116 wrote C. 111. 21. As to ‘ hoe,' in the sense of ‘ propter
hoe,’ see above, S. l. 46, 11. The same person who puts the question ⁴ tune
Syri, etex! ' is here supposed to rejoin, saying, that, though this worthy trib-
une has a colleague a degree less illustrious than himself, he need not think
himself a Paullus3 and besides, though Novius be his inferior in one way, 116
beats him in strength of lunge, “ and that is what we like‚'’ where the speaker
ironicall puts himself for the people.

43. currantque ΙΞῙοτυ tria fitnerafl These would be public fimerels, ‘fu—
nera indictiva,' at w ich the eorpse of the deceased was carried in processioa
from his house, with the noise of trumpets and horns and fifes; and women
(‘praeficae ') singing dirges; and ‘ mimi,' daneers and sta players, who
recited passages suited to the occasion, and sometimes acted t e part of mer-
ry·andrch, mixing mirth with woe3 and after these came men who repre-
sented the ancestors of the deceased, wearing masks suited to each characem-3
and then the corpse on an open bier, which was followed by the relations and
friends, all dressed in black. They went thus in ‚processioa to the Forum,

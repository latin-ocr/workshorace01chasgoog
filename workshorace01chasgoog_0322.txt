17. Seu Libra] What Horace thought of astrology may be collected
'from C. i. 11. He introduces a little of it here to entertain his friend,
showing, at the same time, but little care or knowledge of the subject, and
rather a contempt for it. He says whatever the constellation may have been
under'which he was born, whether Libra, Scorpi0‚ or CapricornuS, his star
no doubt coincided with that of Maecenas, for that their fortunes were one.

20. Capricornus] The sun enters this constellation in the winter. It is
therefore charged with the storms that then occur, and is called the tyrant
of the western wave‚ as Notus is called the lord os the Hadriatic (C. i.

23.) refllyens] Shining in opposition, so as to* counteract his influcnces.
Those who were born when Saturn was visible were supposed to be liable to
all manner of ills. But the star of Jupiter, if it shone at the same time,
would destroy the power of Saturn.

28. sustula-aa] e use of the indicative in hypothetical cascs of this
kind is not easily reduced to rule3 but it seems to coi-respond to the Greek

construction of ἄν with thc indicative. When the condition is not fulfilled,
or is a negative condition, or implies a negation‚ then the consequent clause
may be ex ressed by the indicative mood, in the plu rfcct tense if the action
be a comp ete action and past, in the perfect if it e present. “ Sustulerat
si non levasset ε sed levavit.’' Horace's meaning might be thus expresscd:
“ The trunk had killed me, had not Faunus lightened the blow.’' “ It should
*bellobservess that in sentences of this character the ‘ nisi ' or ‘ si ' always
ο ows. '

Horace was under the particular care of Mercury, the Muses, and Faunus,
to each of whom, as well as to Liber (iii. 8. 7 ), he attributes his preservation
«ἂι this occasion (C. iii. 4. 27). Faunus or Pan was the son of Hermes or

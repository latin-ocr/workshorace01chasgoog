HonAcn on some occasion thought fit to dedicate a pine in his garden to
Diana, and wrote these two stanzas as an inscription perhaps. The dedica-
tion of trees to particular divinities was not uncommon.

ARGUMENT. — Diana, who

erest women in childbirth, to thee Ι dedicate this pine, and will offer thee the κ

sacrifice of a boar.

1, Montium—nemorumque, See C. i. 21. 5, and C. S. 1. Diana shared
with Juno the attributes of acina, the divinity that brings children to the
birth, as explained on C. S. 13. Diana was ⁸ Diva triformis,' as being Luna.
in Heaven, Diana on Ean-th, and Hecate in Hell; whence Virgil speaks of
“ Tei-geminamque Hecaten tria virgi 's ora Dianae '' (Aen. ‘m 511), alluding
(as Horace does) to the statues of t e goddess, with three faces, set up where
three roads met, so that she could look down all three at once, from which
she was called Trivia.

2. laborantes utet-ol For ‘ parturientes?

5. tua —estol ‘be sacred to thee!

6. Quam exactos eqo laetus annosl The antecedent to ‘ quam ' is implied
,in ‘ tua! ‘fir exactos annos ' means ‘ every year,’ as each year is finished.

7. obliquum meditantis ictum] This expresses the wa in which a bom·
strikes at an object with one of its projecting tusks, wit which a wild hog

or lamenting that she could not, for her poverty, offer a worthier sacrifice.

Aneuumae‘r.— My humble Phidyle, lift thy hands to heaven, and bring
the Lares bnt incense, fresh corn, and a suckmg·pig‚ and they shall protect
thy vines and fields and lambs. Herde and flocks, sed on Algidus or Alba,

1. supinas] The clasping of the hands in prayer does not seem to have
been usual with the ancientS. ‘ Supinas ' and ὕπτιος contain the same ele-
.ment, and both signify ‘ npturned.' The ‘ s ' in the Latin word cot-responde
to the aspirato of the Greek, as in ‘ silva’ and ὕλη. As to ‘ nascente Luna,’
see C. iii. 19. 9, n. Phidyle is derived from φείδεσθαι, and means ‘thrifty’
The prose form of ‘ hornus ' is ‘hornotinus.’

4. Lares] These were the Manes or spirits of deceased member-s of a fam-

456 nortus.

4⁷. Galim· praeconica-ut αοίραιεσε] This person, who lived in the time ,
of Lucilius and was noticed by him, is said to have introduced the ‘ aci·

pensa-J which fish is said-to be a sturgcon. In respect to ‘ praeconis,’ see S.
i. 6. 86, n. . -

50. auctor ᾱοουὶι praetorius] It is said one Rufus was the first to bring
into fashion the eating of young storkS. When he lived, it is impossible to
say. He must have served the office of praetor, from the epithet Horace gives
him. The stork went but of fashion, as Ofella predicts; and though gulls
did not take its place, cranes came into vogue. See S. ii. 8. 87. As to
‘auctor,’ see C. i. 28. 14, n. The word ‘ edixerit' is a play upon the ‘edic-
tum ' of the {pi-actor!

52. pravi docilis] ‘ Ever ready to learn what is bad! The construction is
like ‘docilis modorum,' in C. iv. 6. 43. ‘Pi-avus ' signifioe ‘ crooked,’ as op-
{nsed to ‘rectus,' ‘straight’3 and so ‘pravum detorseris,' below (v. 55), is
iterally ‘turn yourself awry.' ‘Pravis talis’ (S. i. 3. 48) are ‘crooked
ankles.’

53. Sordidus α oenm‘] Horace goes on to show that moderation is not
meanness, and that propriety lies in a middle course.

55. Avidienus,] This man was a miser, but'nothing mom is known of
ἔξω. He was ‘ a dirty dog,² and so the name Canis was properly applied to

m.

58. defundere] ‘ Diffundere ' means, as mentioned before, to draw wine
from the ‘ dolium' into the ‘ amphora,' ⁶ testa,’ or ‘ cadu3,' (all the same kind
of vessel‚) in which it was kept till it was fit to drink. When poured thence
into the ‘ crater‚' to be mixed for drinking, it was said to be ‘defusuml
This miser’s wine was of a poor kind, probably not fit to be bottled in the
first instance, but only to be drunk from the ‘dolium.’ He bottled it, and
did not produce it for consumption till it was turned (⁸ mutatum ').

59. licebit Ille repotia] On ‘licebit,' sce Epod. xv. 19. ‘Repetia' was a
‘ coena ' sometimes given, the day after marriage, by the husband. I am not
aware that any ex lanation of the custom is to be met with. The marriage-
dinner was given y the husband. As that was usually a scene of nothing
-but unrestraincd meniment, perhaps the religious ceremonieS, required prop-
erly to inaugurate the new life of the married couple, and to propitiato the
Penates and Lares, were usually deferred to this day3 and the sobrie of
the ‘repotia’ was probably designed to make amends for the licensc ο the
‘ coena nuptialis? The Romans observed their birthdays with religione accu-
Ᾰ ruffi. αῗὸῗιῗαὲΐωΤῗιῐὲγΟὲοῗὶξ cali-egon every holiday to have their togas es ’ally

clean. The ordinary toga was not dyed. The namral whiteness of e wool
was increased by the process of cleaning, in which it was rubbed with differ-
ent kinds of fuller's earth (‘ creta fullonis ’), and also ex sed to stcams of
sulphur, which removed stains of any kind. ‘Albams,’ erefore, significa in
a toga which has just come from the ‘fullo.' It was usual for persons who
were canvassing for offices to have their toga unusually whitened with an
extra supply of ‘ creta‚’ whence they were called ‘ candidati!

cornu ipse bilibri] The ‘ cornu ' was the horn vessel in which the οὒ was
kept. Instead of having a cruet or small vessel suited to the diunentable,
such as wealthy people usually had of silvei· and others of cheaper material,
he would bring down the big horn, and with his own hand (‘ipse Ἴ, lest
others should be too liberal, drop the smallest quantity of oil upon the cab-
bagc, while of his old vinegar‚ which would turn his guestS, if he had any,
from the dish, he was free enough.

64. aiunt] τὸ λεγόμενον, ‘as the saying is! It was perhaps a common
proverb ω express a dilemma, though not now met with elsewhere.

65. Mundus erit qua non] ‘A man will be decent so far· as (‘qua') he

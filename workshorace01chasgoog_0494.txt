sumas. — Book 11. ⁶ 479

Ulysses of all poets after Homer is a contemptible personage, and it must be
said in favor of Hor-‘ace that Penelope, whose character m the Odyssey is
feminine and pure, is by later writers re resented as less chaste than Homer
has drawn her. Those who only know er as the virtuous wife and mother,
win not easily forgive the coarse allusions to her in this Satire.

3. Quid rides 2] These words are spoken by Ulysses. Teiresias may be

prophet's answer means, that, when he gets back to his home, his wits will
soon teach him how to repair his fortune. ‘Jamne ' means, ‘ what, now 1
have told you that you will get home‘l ’

6. te valea] See Hom. Od ss‚ xi. 110. The dialogue is sup osed to be a
Ιοὲιιιὲἑιᾶιέἓὲἓὲ. of that which omer melates, and takes place in ades. See

7. apotheca] See C. iii. 8. 11, n.

9. missis ambaqibua] The ‘ ambages ’ were Ulysses' fine words about
birth and merit, and Teiresias perhaps means, ‘ Since you will have my ad·
vice, let us waste no words, but be in.'

10. Turdus] This bird, the fie dfam, if well fattened, was considered a
great delicacy by the Romans. In Epp. i. 15. 40, the glutton Maenius pro-
nounces that there is nothing better than one of these birds, “obeso nil me-
lius turdo ”3 and the host at Beneventum produced a dish of them in honor
of his visitors, but the were r thing-S, and he did not know how to dress .
them (S. i. 5. 72). he field are is still reckoned a delicate bird. ‘ Privum'
means for your own private catin .

i. 14. Ante Larem] The first-fruxts were offered to the Lares. See Tibull.
“ Et quodcunque mihi pomum novus educat annus
Libatum agricolae ponitur ante deo.''
No divinity was dearer to a Roman than his LareS, whose images stood in
his hall, who reminded him of his departed ancestorS, and whom he invoked
and sacrificed to every day at his meals (see C. iv. 5. 34).

15. sine yeme, Suppose him to be a ‘libertinus,' and in former days to
have run away rom his master, in which case he would be bra‘nded on the
forehead, and the shame of attending him would be greater. He would also
be ⁶ sine gente,' that is, he would belong to no ‘ gens,' if he were a freedman
or the descendant of a freedman.

17. Tu comes exterior] Teiresias advises that, if the rich man should call

were common, and meant to take that side which was most exposed.

ls. Utne teyam] This is a short way of saying ‘ hortarisne me ut tegam ’ἔ ’
‘Damae' iss-pscd generally as a common name of slaves (see S. i. 6. 38).
‘ Spurcus ' is a word Lucilius used, as in that verse quoted by Cicero (Tusc.
ii. 1⁷), “ Ergo hoc poterit ‘ Samnis spurcus homo vita illa dignus locoque ‘3 ’ '’
‘ 20. Ιιοσ] When Teiresias tells him he must be content to be poor, or do
as he bids him, Ulysses consents to the degradation rather than incur the pov-
erty, and makes amerit of doing so: he will bear the disgrace with his usual

E p² i31436). 1¹¹. two 'passages Juvenal alludes to the Lamiae as a family
o distmction §Sam-154, and vi. 385). Tacitus (Anu. vi. 27), mentioning
the death of this Lamia, says his ‘genus ' was ‘decorum' ⁸ ‘

the Lamias thou derivest thy birth from him who founded Formiae and ruled
on the banks of the LiriS‚—a storm is coming3 get in the wood while it is

2. Quando] The same as ‘quoniamst ‘since'

4. ntemores —sasoes,] These were the family records and genealo ies, not
the Fasti Consulares, in which only this Lamia. would appear, and at after
Horace wrote. He was consul A. D. 3. The words occur again in C. iv.
14. 4: “Per titulos memoresque fastOS.'' ‘Fastos' and ‘fastus ' (211 and
4th declension are both found. See Epp. ii. 1. 48, n.

5. ducisl hat Horace says is nearly as follows: ‘ Since it is reported
the first Inmiae had their name from LamuS, and the same tradition has
come down through their successors in the annals of the family, no doubt
you draw your origin from that noble source ' ; —in which there is nothing
more than a little jocular irony, which would amase Lamia, whether it
plcased his family pride or not. The poetS, both Latin and Greek, often
omit the personal pronoun, even when it is wanted for emphasis, as herc and

7. Maricae Litoribus] This means the coast of Minturnae on the borders .
of Latium and Campania, where the nymph Marica, the mother of Latinus,
first king of Latium, was worshipped.

12. aquae—auynrj Sec below, C. iii. 27. 10, “Imbrium divina avis im-
minantum ”3 and Ovid (Am. ii. 6. 34), “ pluviae graculus auctor aquae.'’

14. cras Genium mero Curubis] '¹ Genium curare’ is a phrase not found
elsewhere, ‘ Placare’ and ‘indulgere ' are the usual words. Lamia was
going to keep holiday next day, on what occasion does not ap ear, but as it
was usual to offer sacrifice to the Genius on birthdays, it may ave been his
birthday Lamia was going to keep. As to ‘ Genius‚' see Epp. i. 7 94.

16. operum solatia] This construction, like “ desine querelarum ’' (C. ii.
9. 17), and other expressions there quoted, is similar to the Greek, πόνου
λελυμένοις. On these ·constructions Prof. Key says (L. G. ς 940, and note) τ
“ Occasionally verbs of removal or se aration have a genitive of the ‘ whence ’
in old writers and in poetry.'' “T e legal language here, as in so many
cases, retained traces of the old construction, as in ‘liberare tutelae? '' “ Mo
{Tnzum jam laborum levas ” is a like construction quoted by Mr. Key from

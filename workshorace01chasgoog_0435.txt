wrong, and followed the beaten nack, and would have his son ‘do the same.
Horace expresses the same below, S. 6. 82, sqq. The whole of the passage
there should be compared with this. The elder Horace was no doubt a plain,
sensible man. As to ‘sapiens,' see C. i. 34. 2.

121. For-mahat] This is Horace’s usual word for education. C. i. 10. 2 τ
“ Qui feros cultus hominum recentum Voce formasti.” See C. iii. 24. 54, n.

123. Unum ex judicibus selectis] It was the duty of the Praetor Urbanus
annually to select a certain number of persons whose names were registered
in the Album J udicum Selectorum, and from whom were chosen by lot the
‘judices ' for each trial. It is uncertain whether at this time, or by a subse-
quent ‘ lex ' of Augustus, their functions were extended to civil as well as
criminal proceedingS. The number of these ‘judices ' varied. B the ‘ lex
Servilia Glaucia Repetundarum ' it was fixed at 450. The law at was in
force at the time Horace refers to was the ⁴ lex Aurelia,' by which the· J udices
Selecti were made eligible from the Senators, Equite8‚ and Tribuni Aer-arii.
Horace's father, as plain men are wont, looked up with reverence to the body
in whom were vested such high functions ; but the office was notan enviable

one, gor alwagg most purely exercised. See Ο. iv. 9. 39, n. As to ‘ auctor,'
see a ove, v. .

126. Avidos] This signifies ‘.intemperate‚' as in C. i. 18. 11.

129. Ex Ιιοσ eyo sanus] Horace says that, owing to his father’s trainiug
(‘ ex hoc '), he had been kept in a sound and healthy state, and preserved
from those vices which in their worst form bring destruction, but which in a
moderate degree may be overlooked. He implies that in this venial form he
is liable to such faults3 but even from this smaller measure, time, the candor
of friend8‚ and reflection yvill deduct a‘ oddeal. The. sentence is a little

ing the errors of it. This sort of reflection a man may pursue, if he bein
earnest‚ either as he lies on his bed (see below, S. 6. 122, n.), or as he walks
abroad, alone among crowds. By ‘porticus’ Horace means any one of the
public porticoes, covered walkS, of which there were many at Rome, and
which were usually crowded by persons of all sortS, resorting thither for exer-
cise, conversation, or business.

137. olim] See C. ii. 10. 17, n.

139. Illudo chartis] This means, ‘1 put it down in my notes by way of
amusement? As to ‘ chartae,' see S. ii. 3. 2, n.

of sinners (poets) as bad as himself, and, like the proselytizing Jews (S. 9.

⁸ all. ⁶ Plures ' signifies any number more than one, as in Epp. i. 5. 28, “ Lo-

SATIRE V.

In the spring of the year s, c. 37, M. Antonius brought over an army to
Italy, and a fleet of 300 ships (Plut. Ant. c. 35) : ἔκ τινων διαβόλων παρο-

ξυνθεὶς πρὸς Καίσαρα, says Plutarch. He pretended, Dion sayS, to come
for the purpose of helping to put down Sextus PompeiuS, his real object being

273. εἰ mmmm percusti} ‘ camera? which is from the Greek καμάρα, and
is sometimes spelt with an ‘ a,’ was an archcd ceiling, as ‘lacunar' was flat.
The latter was so called from paneis with raised sideS, and so hav-ing each
the appearance of a ‘ lacus ³ or shallow reservoir, into which the ceiling was
sometimes divided. It was common in rich houses for the ceiling to be richly
ornamented. See C. ii. 18. 2. ‘ Laquear' is another form of ‘ lacunar)
Horace also uses the expression ‘laqueata tecta' (C. ii. 16. 12), which is
found in other writers.

penes te αἵ] This seems to correspond to the Greek ἐν ἐαυτῷ εἶναι, for a
man in his right mind : or it may mean to ask if the man is ‘ suo jure,' which
one who was ⁸ furiosus ’ would not be.

274. cum balbaferae‘a] ‘Yon strike your lisping words against your old
palate,' which means that he talks in a silly, childish way.

275. Adde cruorem Stultitiae] But childish nonsense is not the worst of
this madness. Add bloodshed to folly >and run into t-he most violent exeesaes
of passion, and you will not do more than such lusts commonly lead to.
Such is the Stoic s meaning. ‘Ignem gladio scrutare' is a translation of a.

Greek saying, πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ σκαλεύειν, ‘to stir the fire with the swerd,' which
is attributed to Pythagoraa. To stir the fire of lust with the sword, is to stir

known at the time, but of the actors in it we know nothing.
278. Cerritussue‘t, an commotae] ‘ Cerritus ' means ‘ mad,' but its derivation
is uncertain. ‘Commotus ² is used for different degnees of mental excite-
mcnt. See v. 209, where the meaning is the same as here. Agrippina, who
was of a hasty temper, is called ‘ commotior' b Tacitus (Ann. i. 33). ‘ Cog-
nata vocabula’ means words which may di er in sound, bnt are one in
sense. -
281. Lateranus σας] The next folly noticcd is superstition. Stertinius
tells, by way of illustration, a story of an old ‘libertinus,’ who went from
shrine to shrine crected in the ‘ compita,' spots where two or more streets met,
praying to the Lares Compitales (for whom altars were built in such places,
sce above, v. 26, n.) that they would grant him immortality. This he did
early in the morning, quite sober, aad with hands washed, as became a seri-
ous worshipper. Now this man was sound in hearing and sight3 bnt, says
Stertinius, if his former master had ever wanted to part with him, in putting-
him up ‘for sale he would have cantioned purchasem that-he was not in his

the buyer of any bodily or mental defect in him. To wash the hands and.
feet before offer-ing prayer or sacrifice was a. castum with the Greeks and
Romans. Hector says (ΙΙ. vi. 266) :

The Jews faste on Thursdays and Mondays (⁴‘1 fast twice in the week,”
Luke xviii. 12), in commemoration, it is said, of the ascent of Moses into the
Mount on the fifth day of the week, and of his return on the second. The
raetices of the Jews were the best illustrations of superstition in the eyes of ,
orace and men of the world, and their fast is here perhaps alinded to. See l
note on S. i. 9. 69. On special occasions fasts were ordered at Rome. Tho ' ,

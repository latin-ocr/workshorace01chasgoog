ODE XIII.

Tms Ode expresses a lover-’s jealousy, being addressed to his mistress,
Lydia, who is supposed to be coquetting with a youth named Telephus.

Auentinum. — Lydia, while thou art praising Telephus’s neck, Telephus’s
armS, oh ! my beart is ready to burst. My mind tosses about ; m color
comes and goes ; and the tear stealing down m cheek tells of the s ow fire
that burns within. It gans me „when his rou h ands hurt thy shoulderS, or
his teeth leave their mark on thy lips: thin not he will be constant who
could hurt that nectared mouth. How happy they whom love binds fast, to
the day of their death!

2. cerea Telephi] ‘ Cerea ’ means ‘ white as wax? The Romans wore
their necks and arms bare, the tunic being cut so as to expose the wat aud
upgegffiffiaef ctessgglgffiynpmffigoffgessg} expressed anger by ¹ splen·
dida ' or ‘ vitrea bilis,' and melancholy by ‘ atra bilis ’ (μελαγχολῖα).

6. manet,] The lengthening of a short syllable in such positions is not
uncommon. So C. ii. 13. 16 : “ Caeca. timet aliunde fata.”

12. memorem] ‘ lasting ’ς which will long tell the tale of his violence.

13. Non, — Speras] This more emphatic negative is used not uncom-
monly in prohibitive sentence5‚ instead of ‘ ne,' as ‘⁸ non —sileaS‚’' S. ii. 5.
91 ; “ non ulceret,'’ Ep. i. 18. 72 3 “ non sit qui tollere curet,'' A. P. 460.

16. Quinta parte sui nectar-is imbuit] Some of the Greek poets had notions
about the relative sweetness of nectar ‘and honey which Horace· has here
imitated, and “ quinta parte sui nectaris ’³ probably means honey.

18. irrupta] This word is not found elsewhere.

20. Suprema citius] This construction for ‘ citius quam suprema’ onl
occurs once again in Horace, in ‘⁴ plus vice simplici ’³ (C. iv. 14. 13 j. ⁸»

 

ODE XIV.

Dimum the troubles in Mitylene, his native city, Alcaens wrote an Ode,
of which this seems to be a close imitation. It was written most probably
during the civil wars, that is, between B. c. 41 and 30 (when Horace returned
to Rome). The state is likened to a ship drifting out to sea with its rigging
crippled‚ and in danger of destruction.

Anam-mur. — Thou art drifting again to sea, thou ship; oh! haste, and
make for the harbor3 oars lost, mast split, yards crippled‚ and rigging gone,
how canst thou weather the storm '3 Thy sails are torn, th gods are ne,
and, noble huu— though thou be, there is no strength in thy beauty. 1 thou
be not fated to destruction, avoid the tocke, thou who wert but late my grief,
and art now my anxious care.

6. sine-funibus] ‘deprived of her rigfring? Some understand it to mean
‘without girding ropes,’ referring to St Luke's description of their under-
Ξῗξίἐῖἦ 6tlte ship in which St. Paul was being conveyed to Rome (Acts

10. Non άὶ,] “ Accipit et pictos puppis adunca deos ’' (Ov. Hei-oid. xvi·
112). There was usually a niche in the stem of a ship where the image of*

the tutelary god was kept.

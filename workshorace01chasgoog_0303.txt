O. ii. 10, Int. Who was the other bmther of Proculeius is doubtful, and also
on what occasion he assisted them. They may have lost their property in
the civil ware, as the Scholiasts say. Proculeius was in great favor with
Augustae, and was intimate with Maecenas (who married his sister or cousin,
Terentia), and probably with Sallustius, He was alive at this time, and did
not die till after Horace. Proculeius was, like Maecenas, a favorer of letterS,
and is so referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 94) : “ Quis tibi Maecenas quis nuuc
erit aut Proculeius 21 '’ ,

6. Notus—animi] Horaee's adaptation of Greek consti-actions is one of
the chief features of his style. He uses ‘ metuente ' bere in the same sense as
in C. iv. ⁵. 20, “ Culpari metuit Fides ”2 ‘wings that refuse to melt,’ ὣ
Icarius's did. See C. iv. 2. 2.

9. Latius r ] The only king was the sage, according to the Stoice,
and the sege ept all bis passions under control. See S. i. 3. 125, n., and

10. ’remotis Gadibus] Gades (Cadiz) was taken poetically far the western
limit of the world, so that when Horace would sa his friend Septimius was
willing to go with him to the ends of the eat-tgr, he s·⁴ s ‘ Septimi Gades
aditure mecum ' (C. ii. 6. 1). It was originally, like Cart age, a Phoenician
settlement, of which there were many in Spain, whence Horace says ‘ uterque
Poenus,' the Phoenicians in Africa and those in Hispania.

17. Phraaten] Phraates was restored to the Parthian throne B. c. 25
(C. i. 26, Introd.). It is called the throne of Cyrus, because the Parthians

his tool, throughout his intr-ignes with Cleopatra, till shortly before the battle
of Aetium, when he quarrelled with Cleopatra and joined Augustae, who
received him with favor (Plut. Anton. c. 59). Plutarch calls him ἱστορικός.
Dellius was called ‘ desultor bellorum civilium,’ in allusion to the ‘ desultor’
of the cirene, who rode two horses at the same time. Horace’s way of giving
a name to his odes has been sufficiently noticed, and in this, as in other casce,
there is nothing to guido us to the person whose name he uses. The Ode is
on his usual commonplaees, -- moderatiori, the enjoyment of the present
moment, and the certainty of death.

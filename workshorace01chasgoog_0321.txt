(C. S. 25). The Pareae, who coi-respond to the Greek Μοῖραι, were god-
desses, whose office it was to execute the decreoe of Jove (‘ fata ')‚ which
therefore they knew, and were said sometimes to reveal. They amended,
men at their birth, and foretold their character and for-tunes, and so Horace
says Parca gave him the gists he mentions. The original conception, which

Homer adopts, supposed but one Μοῖρα, and Horace uses the singular

number. But according to the later notions there were three. See next

and to have been received with a plaugffiss the theatre on his first appearance
after his illness (C. i. 20. 3). ut his recovery seems to have been only
partial ; and it would appear that Horace had to listen to his complaints and
apprehensions of death, his sear of which is said to have been great. Horace
remonstrates with his friend in an affectionate way about his complaints and
apprehensione.

Ano-unnim. — Wh kill me with thy complaints ’ἒ Ι cannot survive thee,
Maeeenas; one half o my life being gone, how should the other stay behind ’ἒ
1 have sworn to die with thee, and the monsters of hell shall not separate us·
Our star is one and the same. The power of Jove rescued thee from the
adverse influence of Saturn on that day when thou wert received· with accla-
mations in the theatre, and Faunus at the same time rescued me from death.

Offer thy sacrifice and dedicate thy temple, and 1 will offer my unpretending .

lamb.

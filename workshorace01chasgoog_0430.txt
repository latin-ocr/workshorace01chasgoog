1113 own language (v. 20), that he was good-tempered, notwithstanding his
satirica] vein gr. 53), and again that he was very unreservcd and frank (S. ii.
1. 30-34). he fragments of Lucilius that have come down to us are too
short to form a very accurate opinion u 11, but in some points, at least, (such
as titi? absurd mixture of Greek and lffatim) they bear out Horace's state-
men .

7. Mutatis tantum pedibus] The writings of Lucilius ap ar to have been
very early divided by the grammarians into thirty books, 0 which two thirds
were written in hexameter verse, and the rest m the iambic and trochaic
mensures. That Lucilius imitated the comedians in all but their measureS,
cannot be true. The character of their plays could not be transferred to
satirical poems like his, thou'gh some of their features might suit, as their
coarseness 31111 personalities.

8. Emunctae naris] ‘ Emunctae naris ’ is one who has his nese well wiped,
ἲίιᾱηίρ {hgoeforpsso driveller. Phaedrus explains it in his description of sop

. 111. . v. :—

’ “Aesopus ibi stans naris emunctae senex,

Natura nunquam verba cui poterit dare.”
‘ Emungere' is used by the comic writers for ‘cheating,' as among other
laces (see A. P. 238) in the fragment from the Epiclerus of Caecilius quoted
By Cicero de Am. 26. “ To wipe 3 man's nose for him, is to imply that he
is a driveller who cannot do it for himself, and hence it means to ‘outwit'
and to ‘ cheat' him.’' (Long in loco). Others explain ‘emunctae naris ’ as

‘keen-scented,’ like a bound, which is wrong.

10. versus dictabat] See S. 10. 92, 11. The words ‘stans pede in nno'
mean with the utmost facility, or ‘ standing at ease,' as we might say. Others
explain ‘stans pede in uno ' to mean within the time a man could stand on
one foot. The etheris right.

11. Cumfluerct lutulentus] ‘ Lutulentus ' combines two notions‚ dirtiness
31111 obscur-ity. Lucilius may have imitated the obscenity of the old come-
dians 3 and in this, as in other respects, his verse ma have been like a mud-
dy stream. The word, no doubt, comprehende de ects of taste as well as
3 13.

ψη. piyer scribendi ferre laborem] ‘Piger ferre’ is a. Greek construction,
common in the Odes, but not so in the language of 1113 Satires. (See C. i.
1. 18, 11.) 111 C. iv. 14. 22, we have ‘ impigcr’ 111 1113 331113 construction.

14. Gntspinm minimo] See S. i. l. 120, 11. ‘Minimo me provocat,’ ‘he
offers me the greatest odd3,' literally, ‘he challenges me at the smallest
amount’ to be staked on my side, while he puts down a large one on 1113.
The mention of the negligent way in which Lucilius wrote, leads on to the
mention of small poets of the day, Crispinus and Fannius. See Introduc·
tion.

15. Accipiam tabula-95] This is nothing more than a polite challenge to
333 which could write 111031 verses in a given time. ‘ Take tablets if you

13333, 31111 Ι will take them too.” The omission of the personal pronoun

fore ‘ accipiam ' to ex ress antithesis, is nothing in familiar talk, where
there could be no mista 3. ‘ Custodes ³ are umpires to see that there is no
foul la .

18? rZro ct perpauca Ῑοφιεητίι] ‘ The gods have done me a kindness in
making me of 3 poor and unpretending disposition, that speaks but seldom,
alud very little at 3 time! This is Horace's reply to the challenge, which 113

19. At tu conclusas] Persius imitatas this, S. v. 10.

21. Beatus Fannius] This Fannius is spoken ofin another lace (S. 1. 10.
80) as a contemptible person, and a parasite of Hermogenes 'l‘igellius (S. 3.
129, n.). It appears probable, from Horace’s words, that he had his admir-

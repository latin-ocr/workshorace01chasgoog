«1 will call up from the East,’ which would be an omen of good wcather, and
the erow flying to the mamb, of bad. ‘ Oscines aves ' were birds whose
omens were taken from their note, as ‘ praepetes ' from their ssight.

13. Sis licetjclix] There is a tenderness apart from familiarity in these
two stanzas, which gives much reality to the Ode.

15. laevus vetet ire picus] The woodpecker was a bird of ill-omen. There
was some confusion among the Romans as to the right hand and left in
augury, as to which was the propitious side. The confusion may have arisen
from the different practice of the Greeks and Romans in taking note of birds»,
the former facing the north and the latter the south, as is commonly sup·
posed. But what is confusion to us, was none to a Roman. (C. 26. 5.)

18. Pronus Orion] Orion sets about the beginning of November. On
‘albus Iapyx,' see C. 3. 4 and 7. 15 of the first book.

21. Hostium uxores] So in C. i. 21. 13, sqq„ he prays Apollo to turn away
war, famine, and pestilence from his eoun to her enemieS, the Parthians
and BritonS. Such diversion is common wit the poets‚ as Vi ‘l (Georg. iii.
513), “ Di meliora piis erroremque hostibus illum.'’ The mans used
‘pueri ’ for children of either sex. ‘ Oriens ' is not usually applied to the
rising of a wind, as Horace applies it here.

25. Sic et Europe] The story of Europa, the daughter of Agenor and sis·-
ter of CadmuS, carried off from Phoenicia to Cncte by ZeuS, under the form
otil a bull‚ is told by Ovid, at the end of the second book of the Metamor-

oses.

P 28. Palluit] So ⁴ expalluit’ (Epp.i. 3. 10) and ‘contremuit' (C. ii. 12. 8)
are used transitively.

33. ceratum — oppidis] See Epod. ix. 29. The description is taken from

Homer's Κρήτην ἑκατομπολιν (Ῑὶ. ii. 649). Europa's speech is that of one
just awake to her real position, after the 'terror of her voyage and the depart-
ure of her companion; left alone in a strange land, with the consciousness
of her folly first coming upon her. She begins distractedly, ‘ Father, -
alas 1, I have forfeited a daughter's name, and love bath given place to mad-
ness.

37. Unde quo venir] This implies, not that she was so distraeted that
she had sorgotten whence she had come, but ‘ What an ext-,hange have 1
made! So dear a home for this strange place ! ’ Itis all ve natural and
beautiful. ‘ Una mors ' is perhaps an imitation of SophoclesYAntig. 308):
οὐχ ὗμιν Ἀιδης μοῦνος ἀρκεσει. .

38. qulansne ploro] ⁸ Am Ι awake and weeping for my foul fault, or, free
from guilt, dqth some vain image mock me, which, taking flight from out the
wirly· ἧοῖνῒῗᾎᾞέἶιῧῖαᾊὶα] lfomer (odyss. xix. 562) describes two gates in
the house of Sleep, one of them horn and the other ivory, for the exit of
dreams‚ of which those which came out of the ivory gate were false, those out
of the other, true. virgil has imitated Homer’s description, Aen. vi. 894,
sqch· Cama-efferes 9] Ovid makes ¹¹⁰5. put flowers about the animal's neck:
“flores ad candida porrigit ora,” Met. u. 861.

49. Impudens liqui] ‘ For lack of shame I left my father’s house, for lack
of shame Ι hesitate to die,’ either because she deserved to die, or because her
chastity was in danger. ‘ Orcum moror ’ is equivalent to ‘ dubito mori,’ like
Ovid (Heroid. ix. 146) ε “Impia quid dubitas Deianira mori ”3 but it is an
unusual fonn. Seeing nothing but death before her, she prays to be killed at
once, rather than die a lingering death by hung-cr, and go down to Hades
robbed of her beauty. This notion is Greek, and from the Greek it is prob-
ably imitated. ⁴ Ere ugly leanness seize my love? cheeks‚ and their young ·

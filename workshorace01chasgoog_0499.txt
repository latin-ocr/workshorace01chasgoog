compared with what follows: “ auctius atque Di melius fecere.’' ‘ Ben⁸e est ’
occurs in C. iii. 16. 43, and is familiar in the formula s, v. B. E. v. (si vales
bene est; valeo), which the Romans prefixed to their letters.

5. Maia ωας] Respecting Mei-cury, the god of luck 'and gain, the pro-
tector of poets, and of Horace in particular, see S. ii. 3. 68; C. ii. 7. 133 ii.
17. 29. ‘Proprius ' signifies ⁴ permanent,' see S. 2. 129, n. As to the form
‘faxi1n,' see S. ii. 3. 38, n.

7. vitio culpave] ‘ Culpa’ is often used by the law-writers in the sense of
‘negligence. ‘ Vitium ' appears to mean a defect of the nature, ‘ culpa’ of
the conduct.

8. Si veneror stultus nihil homme] As to ‘veneror,’ ‘to pra for,’ see C. S.
49. This passage has been imitated by Persius (S. ii. 9). ‘ enormare' is
‘to disfigure,' ‘norma’ being the rule by which carpenters or masons keep
their work straight. ‘ Mereenarius ’ is a free laborer who works for pay.

12. amico Hercule ‚VJ Though Hercules was especially a Grecian hero, and
was in no way connected historieall y with the Romam, he was held by them
in high esteem. He was associated with Mercury in various ways; among
others as the god of gain, as he is here. There are representations of the two
gods in one, which combined form is called Ἐρμηρακλῆς, and appears to
hage been very common. The notion seems to be that of combining strength
an cunmn .

13. quodgaaelest] See C. iii. 29. 323 “Quod adest memento Componere
aequuS.’' It is an adaptation of the Greek τὸ παρόν. ‘ Gratum juvat’ may
either mean ‘ satisfies me, for Ι am grateful,’ or ‘is welcome and satisfias
me.

9 n. .
⁹ 18. plumbeus Auster] The south-wind is so called, as depressing the ener-

· gles and spirits. The epithetis very expressive, ‘the leaden south! Com-

pare C. ii. 14. 153 iii. 23. 8; Epp. i. 7. 5. Auster and Notus are not distin·
guishcd by the poets. They are invariably represented as bringing heavy
rains: “ Quid cogitet humidus Auster’' (Georg. i. 462).

19. Libitinae quaestus acerbae] The goddess Libit-ina was one of the old-
est Roman divinities. She presided over funerals and all things pertaining

to the dead. There were kept in her temple all manner of things required
at funerals, where the undertakcrs (hence called Libitinarii) mi ht purchase
or hire them. Also a register os funerals was kept in the temp e, and when
they were registered a see was paid. From both the above sources the tem-
ple would derive increased revenues in a season of ’ great mortality. Horace

twice uscs the name of Libitina as equivalent to Mors. See C. iii. 30. 6, and ·

Epp. ii. l. 493 and Juvenal ‘¹⁰3⁵ the same (S. iv. 122) : “ Nam si Igibitinam

addressed, and the two words were sometimes joined thus: ‘ J anuspater.'
See Epp. i. 16. 59. Ηο was worshipped before tho other gods, because ho
was the medium through whom meu got access to the others (ovid, Fast. i.
171). ‘Janc ' is put in the vocative case by a sort of attraction. (See C. ii.

20. 6, a.) ‘Audire‚' iu the sense of -‘appellari‚’ ἀκούειν, occurs again in S.

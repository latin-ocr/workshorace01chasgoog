ODE VI.

Tms Ode is addressed to Μ. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and general,
and at a later time the son-in-law, of Augustus· It was probably written
after the battle of Actium, where Agrippa commanded the fleet of Augustus
against M. Antonius· He may have asked Horace to write an ode in his
honor, and he declines in a modest way, professing to be unequal to such
kigh exploits, which he places on the same level with those of Homer’s

eroes,

Amnum. — Varius shall sing in Homeric strain of th victories by
sea and land. My humble muse docs not sing of these, o the wrath of
Achilles, or the wanderings of Ulysscs, or the fate of Pelops's house, nor will
she disparage thy glories and Caesar’s. Who can fitly sing of Mam, mail-
clad, — of Meriones), black with the dust of Troy, —of Diomed‚ a match
for gods ’.ἱ Ι sing but of feasts, and of the battles of boys and girls,

1. Scriberis] See next Ode, v. 1, n. L. Varius Rufus was a distin ished
epic and tragic poet frequently mentioned by Horace, with whom e-was
intimate, and whom he introduced to Maecenas. He was popular with his
contemporaricS, and much admired by them. Augustus also had an affec·
tion for him (see Epp. ii. 1. 247).

2. carminis ale·te,] ‘ Alite ’ is in apposition with ‘ Vario! Translate, ‘bird
of Homeric song-st In prose the ablativo of the agent without a preposition
is not admissible. But Horace has the same construction, C. iii. 5. 24. S. ii.
1., 84. Epp. i. 1. 94. It is most frequently found in Ovid. Homer is called
⁶ Maeonius ³ from the fact that Smyrna, a town of Lydia, more anciently
called Maeonia, >was one of those that claimed to be his birth lace.

3. Quam rem cunque] The construction is by attraction. he full expres-
sion would be ‘ scriberis et scribetur omnis res quamcunque.’ Agrippa’s
great successes up to this time had been in the Pei-usian war against L.
AntoniuS, B. c. 41 (in which he had the principal command under Augus-
tus), in Gaul and Germany, by land; and against Sex. Pompeius and at
Actium, by sea„

4. te duce] See next Ode, v. 27, n.

5. neque haec — nec gyravem] This is as if he had said t ‘ 1 should not think
of singing of these victorics, any more than 1 should of the wrath of Achilles?
Compare C. iii. 5. 27 -3o:

“ Neque amissos colores
Lana refert medicata succ,

Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit

Curat reponi deterioribus?
‘ As the stained wool does not recovcr its lost color, so true virtue once lost
will not be restored to the degener-ate? ‘ Gravem stomachum ' is a transla-
tion of μῆνιν οὐλομένην (Il. i. 1), and ‘ cedere nescii ’ is explained by ‘ inexo-
rabilis‚’ A. P. 121. This construction with ‘ nescius ' is not uncommon.
Vim-il, Aen. xii. 527 : “Rumpunt-ur nescia vinci pectora.’' Ovid, Ep. ex
Pont. ii 9. 45 ι “ Marte ferox et vinci nescius armis.''

7. duplicis διπλοῦς, ‘ double-minded or 'double-tongued‚’ as hc is de-
scribed by ecuba in Euripides’s play of the Trojan Women (v. 285) :-

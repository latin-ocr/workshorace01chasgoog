In n. c. 1⁷, Augustus ‘celebrated the Ludi seculares, and
Horace waerequiredtouritoanode for the occasion, whichhe
did, and it han been preserved. This circumstance, aud the
credit it brought him, may have given his mind another leaning
to (hiemi-iting, and have helped him to produce the fourth book,
a few pieoeo in which may have been written at any time. It
in said that Augustus particularly desired Horace ιο publish an-
other book of odes, in order that those he wrote upon the vieto-
ries of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in it. The
latter of dieue Odee vae not written, probably, till Β. o. 13, when
Augustum returned from Gaul. 11² eo, the book was probably

' publiehed in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. The odes οὶ

the fourth book show no diminution of power, bat the reverse.
There are none in the first three books that sul-pase, cr perhaps

during that time, 1 think it probable‚ hc wrote the Epistles to ’
Augustus and Florus which form the second book3 and having
conceived the intention of writing a poem 'on the art and progressu
of poetry) ,he wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the
Pisones which has been preserved among his works, It acerne,

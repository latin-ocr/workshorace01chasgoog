Augustus. The Muse is asked whom she will praise‚ -Jove and his chil-
dren, or some one of the worthies of Rome, of whom many are mentioned,
beginning with Romulus and endin with Augustus, of whom it is declar-ed
that heis under the especial cure o Jove, and that he holds from him the
sceptre oi the world. These persons are mentioned without reference to
chronological order, and it does not appear why some were chosen rather
than others of more or equal note who are omitted.

whose woods followed the sweet music of Orpheus? Whom, before the

Numa, or proud Tarquin, or Cato, who nobly diedss Rea-ulus and the

2. sumis celebr-ara] See i. 1. 8, n. Horace invokes the Muses without
much discrimination ; but Clio is not impropcrly invoked here, as the Muse
o'f history, to which the names of the worthies recountcd belong. Calliope,
the Epic Muse, is invoked C. iii. 4. 2 ; Melpomene, the tragic, is asked for a
(Ergo, i. 24. 3, and is invoked by Horace as his patroness in iv. 3 ; Euterpe
and Polymnia, the proper lyric MuseS, occur i. 1. 33. ‘ Imago ' is used ab·
solutely for the echo (for which the Romans had no corresponding term) by
Cicero, Tusc. iii. 2: “ ea (laus bonorum) virtuti resonat tanquam imago. '
’ Virgil gives the full expression, Georg. iv. 50: “ Vocisque offensa resultat

imago.' Sge ‚C. i. 20. 8. Our verse-writers are fond of Horace's epithet‚
‘ s ortive ec o.

lg. Heliconis on's] Helico was a range of mountains in Boeotia, and Pin-
dus between Thessaly and Epirus. Both were celebrated as the abodes of
the Muses. Haemus was a range on the north of Thrace, and Orpheus was
a· Thracian. See A. P. 391, 405, n. ⁸

9* Arte materna] Orpheus was the son of the Muse Calliope. .

variusque mundum —horz'sJ ‘ Mundum ' here signifles ‘ the sky,' as in
Georg. i. 240, and ‘ horis ' has its Greek signification, —- ‘ seasons.'

17. Unde m‘l majus] ‘Unde ' occurs several times in Horace as referring
to persons. See, ,among other places, Cicero de Senect. 4, fin„ “ fore unde
discerem neminem.”

19. Proximos] This, signifying the next in order without reference to
distance, does not contradict what goes before. ‘ Secundum ‘ means
close proximity. Panas is said to hold the next place to Jupiter, not

by the hand, and said, “ 1 have need of thee still ”3 and he detained him a
whole year, saying, “ silence, too, hath its sase reward.’' Horace’s indigna-
tion is levelled against the breaking of saith generally, and the ‹livulging of
the secrete of Ceres (whose rites‚ however, it appearS, were only attended
by women) is only mentioned by way of illustration. Secrccy is a sign of
good saith, and not an easy one to practise. There are few moral qualities
that can be said to take precedence of it. It is the basis of friendship, as
Cicero says, and without 1t society cannot exist. (Compare S. i. 4. 84, n.)
Itis probable, if Plutarch's story be true, that Horace had heard Augustus
repeat his favorite axiom.

ODE 111.

Tms Ode commends the virtue of perseverant-e by the example of heroes
who had secured divine honors by it. Juno is introduced as making a long
speech to the assembled gods, when it was proposed to admit Romulus
among them. This speech is contrived in order to introduce the glory and

extent of the Roman empire and the praises of Augustae. It also contains .

indirect exhortations to abstinenoe and contaminent, and so bears on the
general scope of these Odes. It is said that Julius Caesar meant to transfer
the seat of empire to Alexandria in TroaS, or to Ilium; and perhaps in
Horace's time, among the remedies proposed for the evils of the state, some
may have freely spoken of transferring the seat of government to another
spot. It is equally probable that the site of Troy, the city of their ancestors
and the fountain of their racc, may have been fixed upon for that purpose.
To meet the spirit of avarice in some, and restlessness in all that would be
mixed u with such a notion, seems to have been another purpose of this
Ode. T e Romans attached much importanoe to the legend which derived
their origin from the TrojanS. See S. ii. 5. 63.

‘Lymphae’ and ‘N phae’ are essentially the same word, but Nympha are
not elsewhere calle Lymphae. These Nympha am the Naiadas, who pro-

100. Judaeus Apsum] The majority of the Jews at Rome were freedmeu‚
and ‘ Apella’ was a common name for ‘ libertini-³ Their creed was a su r-
stition of the most contemptible kind, in the e es of a Romam and a ew
was only another name for a credulons fool. The Jews returned their con-
tempt with hatred, which showed itself in a turbulent spirit that made them
very troublesome. Horace intimatos that he had lem-nt from the school of
Epicurus that the gods were too happy to mind the small affairs of this
world, which hmpmssee in the words of Lucretius (vi. 57): “Nam bene
qui didicere deos securum agere aevnm.'' See C. i. 34. 2, ιι, and the Ina-o-
duction to that Ode.

104. Brundisium] From this abrupt conclusion, we may judge that Horace
had got tired of his‘journal as well as his journe . Brundislum.(Brindisi)
was or centuries the most important town on e eastern coast of Italy,
chiefly thro h the convenience of its position for communicating with
Greece, and e excellence of its barbor- Its distance from Egnatia was
thirty-five miles. There was a station named Speluncae (now Grotta Rosa)
midway‚ where the party ma have halted one night, and which Horace,
having nothing he cared to te us about it, has passedover in silence.

SATIRE VI.

ΙΝ addition to the obloquy brought upon him by his Satires, Horace, aster
bis intimae with Maecenas had begun to be known, had to meet the envy
such good ortune was sure to excite. His birth would fun-nish a handle for
the enviouS, and he was probably called an upstaaet, aad hard names of that
sort. In this Satin, which is nothing but an epistle to Maecenas, he spurns
the idea of his birth being any objection to him, while, at the same time, he
argues sensibly against men trying to get beyond their own legitimare spherc,
and aimin at honore which are only attended with inconvenieuce, fatigue,
and ill-wi . This Satire, besides the good sense and good feeling it contains,
is valuable as bearing upon Horace's life. nis introduction to Maecenas is
told concisely, but fully, and with much propriety and modesty3 and nothing
ean be more leasing than the filiai affection and titude shown in those
parts that re ate to his father, and the education e gave him. He takes
pleasure in referring whatever merits he might have to this good -parent, as
he did in the fourth Satire.

The Satire, then, may be supposed to have been written chiefly for the pur-
pose of disarming envy, by showing the modesty of the anthor’s pretensions,
and the circumstances that led to his intimacy with Maecenas. The views of
public life which it contains were no doubt sincere, and the daily rontine
described at the end was better suited to Horace's habit of mind than the
fatigues and anxieties of office. There is not the least appearance in any of
his writings of his having been spoiled by his good fortune and by his inter-
course, on terrns of rare familiariry, with Augustae, Maecenas, and others:
fild probably malignity never attacked any onclese deserviug of attack than

orace.

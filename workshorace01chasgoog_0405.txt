12. mim] There is no variation in the MSS. here, but the sense
would seem to requIre ‘ mancipatus? ‘⁴ ‘ Mancipatio ’ is the form by which
a person who was not ‘ suijuris ' was transferred to the ‘ potestas ⁹ of another,
as in the case of adoption. ‘Emancipato' seems to be the proper term to
express the making a person ‘ sui juris ³ by the act of ‘ mancipatio ’ ς but
‘ mancipo ’ and ‘ emanclpo ’ are often confounded in the MSS.” Here, how·
ever, we must take ‘ emancipatus ³ as the true reading, and it can only sig-
nify ‘ sold into slavery? There may be a shade of difference in the meaning
of the words, which it is not easy to trace.

his weapons of offence and defenee, but an axe, saw, chain, etc. The accou-
trements of a Roman soldier were very heavy, but they had slaves (‘ calones ')
who helped to carry them. See C. ii. 13. 18, n.

aequata numero regemque canebant.” The Galli were cavalry of -atia (or

aureos Curi-as] A gilded chan-iot was used by conquerors in their triumphs.

EPODE V.

Tuam: is much likeness between this singular Ode and part of the eighth
Satine of the first book. A scene is represented in which the unfortunate
woman Canidia (Epod.i1“i. 8, n.), satirized by Horace for a succession of
years, is the chief actress. She is passionately in love with one VaruS,
whom she calls an old sinner, but whose heart she is resolved to win. To

bring branches from the tombS, a screech-owl’s wing‚ and eggs steeped in
frogs' blood, poisonous hei-bs of Thessaly and Hiberia, and bones snatched
from the Jaws of a hungry bitch, to burn in the magio flames. Sagana
meanwhile sprinkles wasers of Avernus over the chamber, and Veia digs a

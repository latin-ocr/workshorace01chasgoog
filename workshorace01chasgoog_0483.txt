186. Astuta inqenuum] This appears to be nothing bnt a suitable illustra-
tion invented by Horace. It is obvious enough, and we need not suppose it
*a qrglffeligeogussselxtrrheageffflffid ξ’ἰιεὲρεὲἔιιέῃίζ galgalam the remonstrance of
Ulysses with Agamemnon, in the Ajax of Sophocles (v. 1328, sqq.), aster
Ajax has destroyed himself. ‘ Veto usually governs the infinitivo mood.
Once more, us here, Horace uses it with ‘ ne’ and the subjunctive (Epp. ii. 1.
239), and once with the subjunctive, bnt without ‘ne ’ ·( C. iii. 2. 26). Tibul-
lus has ‘veto' with ‘ut': “Illius ut verbis δὴ mihi lenta ‘veto'’ (ii. 6. 36).
‘ Atrida ' is the later form of the vocative. The Greek ⁸ Atride ' is used in
Epp. i. 7. 43. ‘ Cur' is awkwardly placed, as it is in S. 7. 104. The eon-
nection with what precedes lies in the extravagsnt and imperious conduct of
the king, as illustrating the excesses of pride, and proving that madness is
found in high places and in the heart of kings. Stet-timus, it must be re-
membered, is exposing the folly of ambition. The dialog-ne is supposed to
be between-Agamemnon and one of his soldiers, in view of the unburied

just that Ι command.' There is a good deal of irony here. The justice of
the command is secondary to the will of the desp0t‚ and his subject is ready,
with instinctive awe, to admit that it is so; but the tyrant eondeseends to
justify his act3 and the man of low degree, not without trembling and doubt
and astonishment at such condescension, ventures to ask that his reason'may
be enlightened a little, in order that he may learn to acquiesce willingly.
Stephens quotes a Greek proverb, μωρῷ καὶ βασιλεῖ νόμος ἄγραφος, ‘Fools
and kings are govemed by an unwritten law! Compare Juvenal, “ Sic volo
sic jubeo; stat ro ratione voluntas ’³ (vi. 223).

197. ΜῙΕ ovium] “ ‘ Mille ’ in the singular is commonly an adjective; 'in
the plural, perhaps always a substantive? An exception to the latter art
of this rule occurs above (S. i. 6. 111). ‘ Morti dedit' is exactly equiv ent
to our ‘ put to death.’ ‘ Do' means ‘ to put ' ς so its compounds ‘abd0,’ ‘ to
put away'; ‘addo,' ‘to put to’; ‘cond0,’ ‘to put together'; ‘dedo,' ‘to
put down' (one’s arms); ‘dido,’ ‘to put asunder or distribute'3 ‘ed0,’ ‘to
put forth ' ; ‘ ind0,’ ‘ to put on ’ ; ‘trad0,’ ‘ to put across, to hand over,' etc.

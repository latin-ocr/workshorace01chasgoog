8. Ad umbilicum adducere] The several sheets of parchment on which the
eontents of a book were wntten were Jomed together, and at the end of the
last was fastened a stick on which the whole was rolled‚ like our maps 3 and
in the same way, at the ends of this noller, were knobs, which were called
‘ cornua ’ or ‘umbilici' The former word is obvious enon h. The latter
belongs more properly, perham, tq the shape that the ends o the roll would
take when these kno s were wanting ‚ but lt was also apphed to the knobs

ments that have comc down to us3 but it is mentioned by others besides
Horace, and he is known to have been one of Anacreon's chief favoritcs.
He was a grateful pei-former on the flate, which accomplishment Anacreon
took dclight in praising. One of the Odes falsely attributed to Anacreon is
addressed εἷς νεώτερον Βάθυλλον · and from that we also leam that he was
a Samiau, ἢν δ’ ἐς Σάμον ποτ’ ἔλθῃς Γ άφε Φοῖβον ἐκ Βαθύλλου. Ana-

whom she has caught, and warns him that, be he rich and wise as he may,
she will soon leave him for another. Horace introduces the same name in a
much later Ode (iii. 14. 21), and it is used throughout the third book of
Elegies commonly attributed to Tibullus. The Ode is in Ovid’s style, and
worthy to have been written by him.

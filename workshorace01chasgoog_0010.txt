Tun materials for Horace’ s life are derived almost entirely
from his own works. A few additional facts are obtained from
a short memoir, attributed to Suetonius.

He was born on the 8th of December, Α. u. c. 689 (Β. c. 65), at
οι· near Venusia ¹* (Venosa), in the Apennines, on the borders of
Lucania and Apulia. His father was a sreedman,† having, as
his name proveS, been the slave of some person of the Horatia
gens. As Horace implies that he himself was ingenuum his
father must have obtained his freedom before his birth. He
aflerwards followed the calling of a σπείσῃς a collector of money
in some way or other, it is not known in what. He made, in
this capacity, enough to purchase an estate, probably a small one,
near the above town, where the poet was born. We hear noth-
ing of his mother, except that Horace speaks of both his parents
with affection.n His father, probably seeing signs of talent in
him as a child, was not content to have him educaoed at a pro-
vincial school, but took him (at what age he does not say, but
probably about twelve) to Rome, where he became a pupil of
Orbilius Pupillusff who had a school of much note, attended by

boys of good family, and whom Horace remembered all his life
as an irritable teacher, given unnecessarily to the use of the rod.

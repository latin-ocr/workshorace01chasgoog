EPISTLES. — Boou 1. 515*-

try. of these twenty-siit, ten appear to have been swallowed up by the· con-
quests of Porsenna (see Epod. 16. 4), and of the remaining sixteen the Fabia
was one. The number was graduall increased from sixteen to thirty-one ;
but it was not till B. c. 243, towards t e end of the first Punic War, that the
Quirina and Velina were added, being composed of persons belonging to
Cures and Velinus in the Sabine territory. (Liv. Epit. xxx.) These were the
last tribes that were formed.

53. laic sasoes dabit] On the ‘fasces ² and curule chair, see S. i. 6. 97.
‘Importunus’ means ‘obstinate’ or ‘ill-natured’; ‘facetus‚’ ‘politess ι

56. lucet, eamus Quo ducit qula ς] ‘ The da has dawned, let us be off and
la in our supplies ; let us hunt and fish, as arg-ilius hunted when he bought
a ar, and pretended he had caught it himself '5 that is to say, let us go to
market. Who is meant by Gargilius, we have no means of knowing. The
name is Roman. It occurs in inscriptions. He wanted to establish his repu-
tation as a huntsman: got up before daybreak and returned to the city before
the morning was over, and passed through the Forum while it was full of
people‚ with netS‚ spearS, and men, and a mule carrying a bear, which he had
not cau ht, but purchased.

58. aqas, venabula,] As to ‘plagae,' sec C. i. 1. 28, n. They were too
large to be carried by men, and were laden on mules. (See Epp. 18. 46.)
They were sometimes of enormous extent, as stated in Epod. ii. 32. The
‘ venabulum ’ was a long hunting-spear‚ with a barbed point. virgil (Aen.
iv. 131), describing the hunting-party of AEneas.and Dido, says τ ,

“ Retia rara, plagae, lato venabula· ferro,
Massylique ruunt equites et odora canum vis-’³
They were used, not for throwing‚ but thrusting.

61. Gradi tumidique lavemur,] It would seem that some gluttons, with the
idea of renewing their appetite, went to bathe immediately after dinner, as
well as ( which was the general practice) immediately before. Sudden death
was sometimes the effect of this foll . See Juvenal 1. 142.

62. Caerite cera nymss] Caere ( ervetri) was a very ancient town of Etru·
ria, about twenty-seven miles north of Rome. About Β. c. 354, the people
of Tarquinii having taken up arms against the Romans, the Caerites were
accused of aiding them, and were threatened· with punishment; but having
asked ardon, they obtained it at the expense of half their territory. They
were a so granted the Roman franchise, without the ‘ suffragium ’ or right of
voting for magistrate& ‘ Caeritum cerae,' or ‘tabulae,' would mean properly
a register of the inhabitants of Caere, who would be registered when they
came into the above relation to Rome. But it seems probable that, at this
time, the name applied to the registers of all those who were in the position
of ‘aerarii‚' that is, of the citizens of such towns as had not the perfect fran-
chise; and of those citizens who had for an cause been degraded from their
tribes. Thus Horace meane, that they w o took such a low view of life
were not worthy of being Roman· citizenS‚ being more on· an equality with the
erew of UlysseS, whom Circe turned to swine (Epp. 2. 23, n.), and who slew
and ate the kine sacred to the Sun, though they swore they would not, and
their return home dependcd on their oath being ke t. See Odyss. xi. 105,
sqq.; xii. 303, sq.; 340, sqq. ‘ Remigium ’ is used or the rowers, as ‘man-
cli‘piumss ‘ servitium,’ are used for a slave, and many other words are used in
t Ξὲῗηὲῖἶῗῖιῆηωηω uti censet,] Horace was familiar, we may be sure, with
tho writings of Mimnermus, the elegiae poet of Smyrna. He preferred him
to CallimachuS, as appears from Epp. ii. 2. 99, sqq. His poetry is of a mel-
ancholy east, as far as we can judge from the few fragments that have come
down to us: though love was their principal theme and the onl remedy he
recognizes for the ills of life, it does not seem as if he was very happy in his

3. Thracane vos Hebrusque] The first of these is the Latin form of the -

Greek Θρῄκη. It has been observed before, that Horace generally uses dhe

Latin terminations in the Satires and EpistleS, and the Greek in the Odes. ·

The Hebrus he elsewhere calls “ hiemis sodalem '’ (C. i. 25. 19). 'liberius
passed through Macedonia and Thrace on his way to Armenia. (See Inm-
aetion.

4. vicgnas inter currentia tuma} ‘ Turris ’ may mean a castle or fortified

place, and one of these that Horace mentions is robably Abydos, on the
Asiatic shore of the Hellespont. The other may ave been Sestos, on the
Europcan side. The strait takes a bend to the northeast between the two
terrim, and Abydos stood directly south of Sestos, at the⁴ distance of thirty
stadia. The current runs very strong between them, and this is expressed
in the text ς notwithstanding which, there is a popular story that Leander, a
youth of AbydoS, swam across repeated ly by night, to visit Hero, the priest-
ess of Venae, at Sestos, Ovid has two EpistleS, supposed to have passed
between the lovers (Heroid. 18, 19) 3 and Virgil (Georg. iii. 258, sqq.) refers
to the story.. The same adventure was accomplished by Lord Byron and a

is sometimes used in a bad sense, as we nse ‘ assume,’ ‘ presume ’; but it is
not so here. It is the word Horace generally uses in this connection. See
A. P. 38. With ‘diffundit in aevnm' compare Ο. iv. 14, init.

9. Quid Titius Romana] of Titius the Scholiasts say, that he was a trag-ic
'and lyric poet. According to Horace, he was not afraid to imitate Pindar.
This young man was more rash than Horace himself (C. iv. 2. 1). There is
no one upon record with whom the person in the text can be identified,
though some suppose he may be the person Tibullus mentions (i. 4. 73),
“ Haec mihi quae canerem Titio Deus edidit ore.'’

venturus in ora 5²] This expression may have taken its rise from Ennius’s
“ volito vivu’ per ora virum‚' which Virgil has imitated once or twice.

10. expalluit] This is used as in C. iii. 27. 27, “ mediasque fraudes Pal-

lmltlffugztffs et rivos ausus apertos-‚l These are opposed to the deep and hid-

den springs of Pindar’s genius
14. An tragica desaevit et ampullatur] The first of these words refers to the

passione represented in tragedy, the other to the pompona words employed
by inferior writers to express them. ‘Ampulla’ signifies a sort of bottle
with a big mund belly, and corresponds to the Greek λήκυθος, which was
used to signify great, swelling words. Horace appears to have been the first
to substitute the Latin words ‘ ampullari ⁸ and ‘ ampulla ’ (the first of which.

15. Qui milii Celsus a 2⁶12] ‘ Quid agis ’ is the common formula for
‘How d' e do'ss’ See . i. 9. 4 ; Epp. i. 8. 3. η Celsus is most probably
Celsus A binovanuS, to whom the eighth Epistle is addressed. We know ·

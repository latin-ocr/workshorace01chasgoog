60. Quisquis πίε vitae sentam color-,1 This loose collocation of words is not
uncommon in Horace. It ought not to be imitated.

Ο puer, ut sis] See Introduction. This sentence illustrates the rule re-
zffigfflffsssghssig‘it‘ss‘a ²¹:3¹²» ‘1¹23' ιζὲὴέὲῗὲὲῗ» ῑῗὲξῖΐῗνΐῖῗέἑῗῖἑ &sifi
the note (i1s “ Observe that the Latin inserts a negative where the En'glish has
none, an mee versa ”

64. Detrahere et pellem] Compare Epp. i. 16. 44. Each of the Scipiones
had a Laelius for his intimate compamon. This is C. Laelius SapienS, the
friend of P. Scipio Africanus Minor, and well known through Cicero’s trea-
tises ‘ De Senectute ' and ‘ De Amicitia,' in the former of which he is a listen-
er, in the latter the principal speaker. As to the following verse, see C. iv.
8. 18, n. Lucilius was on terms of close intimacy with these two friends.

67: Metello] Q. Caecilius Metellus had the cognomen Macedonicus given
him, for bis successes against Andriscus, the pretender to the throne of Per-
seus, king of Macedonia. Horace means to say that Scipio and Laelius were
not offended at the wit of Luciliu3‚ uor feared it might turn upon themselveS,
when they saw him attack Metellus, Why he did so is uncertain.

68. Lupo] Who Lupus was is not certain. His name appears in many
oi the fragments of Lucilius. The most probable person is 1.. Cornelius
Lentulus Lupus, who was consul Β. c. 156. What he had done to provoke
Lucilius’s satire we do not knOW, but Cicero (De Nat. Deor. i. 23) has pre-
served a verse of his in which Lupus is classed with the pet-jared and prof-
hgffgni Primores populilr ‘Atqui,' which is a fonn of ‘at quin,' means ‘ but
he did, did he not ’ἒ ' ‘ ributim‚' throughout all the tribes · he attacked the
optimates and plebeianS, and all without distinction. As to the tribes, see
Epp. i. 6. 52, ιι. ‘ Ae uus' means ‘favorable to.’

72. Virtus Scipiadae On this form, see above, v. 17. See also S. i. 2.
32, n., on the expression ‘ virtus Scipiadae? Laelius, as above mentioned,
had the cognomen Sapiens given him, and any one who reads Cicero’s trea-
tise that bears his name will understand Horace's epithet ‘ mitis! One of
the Scholiasta relates a story of Laelius running round the dinner-table, and
Lucilius pursuing him with a napkin, to flog him. Lucilius was born Β. c.
148, aud Scipio died B. c. 129. He was therefore but a boy when he thus
played with these friends3 and if, as Horace’s language implies, he wrote
satues in Scipio's lifetime, they were probably the mere intemperate sallies
of youth. But Horace may be mistaken. The fare of these great meu ww
of the simplest kind. (See note on S. i. 6. 115.)

75- Infra Lucili censum] Horace had before intimated (ν. 34, ιι.) that he,
·a poor man's son, born in a provincial town, was not to be com ared with
Lucilius, a Roman citizen, who was rich, and had a fine house in t e Forum.
· 78. nisi quid tn, This is equivalent to saying, ‘ This is what I think, Tre-
batius5 but Ι shal be glad to defer to your opinion if you differ from me!

79. nihil hinc dtffindere {nassum} The meaning os ‘ diffindene' is not quite

clear. Perhaps it has the same sense as ‘secare' above (S. i. 10. 15, and
Epp. i. 16. 42) ; that iS‚ ‘to decide.’ If so, Trebatius says he cannot decide
the question from the premises Horace has put before him (⁸ hinc ’).
'. 80. Sed tamen] By the XII. Tables, the writing of scurrilous verses was
among the few offences that were punishable with death. See Dict. Antt.‚
'Ara ‘ Injuria‚' and compare 'Epp. ii. l. 153. There was a ‘lex Cornelia de
injur-iiS‚’ which probably included the offence of writing scurrilous verses.
When Trebatius says there is ‘jus judiciumque,' he means that there is law,
'and also there are legal proceedingS, sor this case. ‘ Ne forte ’ is used as in
C. iv. 9, l, where see note, and compare Epp. i. 1. 133 18. 58; ii. 1. 208.
‘ Sanctarum ' is a participle, ‘ quae sanciuntur! ⁴ Sancite le m ’ was ω
affix the penalty to a ‘lex,' and so give it effect. See Oie. de . c. 12.

The treaty Horace alludes to may be that between Romulus and Tatius, king
of the Sabinos, by which the two nations became one (Livy i. 1-3). ‘ Aequa-
tu8,' iu this sense of treaties οι· agreements made on equal τοι-ωε, does not
0οὲιὲ ἵξιῗιῑζῗῒῖῖιθῆι libros,] The College of Pontiffs had books containing the

lations by which they were guided, and all matters pertaining to their
ο oe, and the worship of the ds, the general super-vision of which was their
princi al duty. The origin books were, according to tradition, given to
them y Numa at their first ereati0n3 but they were added to from time to
time, and they must have been numerous when Horace wrote. Some parts
were no doubt very anti uated in expression and ideas.

annosa volumina vatum, Not long after this Epistle was written, Augustus
caused a multitude of books professing to be Sibylline eracles, and others of
a prophetie character, to be burnt (see C. 9. 5, ιι). These that were counted
genuine he preserved in the Capitol.

31. Nil intra est deam] This may be a proverb, meaning we may believe
any absurdity, or disbelieve our seuseu if because the oldest poets of Greeee
are the best, therefore Roman poets must be weighcd in the same scale, why
then the olive is hard without and the nut is soft3 we are at the height of
good fortune; we paint, we sing, we wrestle, better than the Greeks; which
every one knows is not the ease.

35. quotus arroyet annus] See C. iv. 14. 40, n. Horace uses ‘decidere'
(v. 36) in the same sense in C. iv. 7. 14.

45. caudaeque pe'Ios ut equinae] When the soldicrs of Sertorius insisted on
attacking the enemy against his wish, and wem beaten, he took the following

man by the young one. They were desii-ed to pull the hair out of th’e tails of
the anmals, and the strong man pulled at his with great force, while the little
man proeeeded to ull out the hau-s of the other, one by one. The weak man
soon aeeom lishe his work, while the strong man of course failed. (Plu-
tarch, Vit. gei-t. e. 16.) Horace appears to refer to this story, which was
probably well known. The application here is plain, though it has no very
close analogy to the original.

46. demo et item] Terence uses ‘ et item! Andria (i. 1. 49) : “ Sed post-
quam amans accessit pretium pollicens Unus et item alter ”3 and Lucretius
(W. 5⁵3) ο “ Asperitas autem vocis fit ab asperitate

Pnncipiorum, et item levor levore creatur?

4⁷. ratione noentae‘s acervi] The Greeks had a logical term called σωρίτης
(from σωρός, ‘acervus,’ a heap), signifying a series of propositions linked
together and depending each upon the one before it, till a conclusion is come
to which connects the first proposition with the last ς but it may go on for
ever without any conclusion at all. The invention of the σωρίτης is attrib-
uted to Chrysippus the Stoic.

48. Qua· redit infimos] The word ‘fasti,' as applied to records, belonged
properly to the sacred books or tables in which the ‘ fasti ' and ⁴ nefasti dics '
were distinguished, that is, the Calendar. When these were made public
(Livy ix. 46), calendars became common, and in these (which were usually
engrared on tables of stone) remarkable events were inserted, so that they

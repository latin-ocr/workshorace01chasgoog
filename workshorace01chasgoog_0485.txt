fstoen fowls. The ‘ scurrae,’ ‘ parasita, were sent for to help to consume all

this quantity of provisions, and to entertain the new heir.

cum I’elabm] The Velabrum is said to have derived its name from the
verb ⁴ vehere‚' because the ground.was originally a swamp traversed by boats.
It was the name of that part of the city which lay between Mons Capitolinus
and· Mons Aventinum, from the Tiber to the Circus Maximus. Here, too,
there appears to have been a collection of shops of the better sort.

omne macellum] There were in earlier times different markets for the sale
of different provisions, as the ‘ forum boarium ' for oxen‚ ‘olitorium ' for veg-
etablcs, ‘piscarium ³ and ‘piscatorium ’ for fish, ‘ cupedinis ³ for delicacieS,
etc. These were afterwards (the time is uncertain) all transferred to one
large market, on the site of the ‘forum cupedinis,' on the north side of the
Sacra Via, not far from the Forum Romanum. This market was called
Macellum, the diminutive form of ‘ maceria: the wall with which it was sur-
munded.

232. vel nunc pete vel cras] This seems to mean ‘whenever you please!

233. aequus .·] This is ironical. The young man, affecting to be just,
shows a wauton extravagance towards the most profligate persons.

234. In nive Lucana] It appears from this passage and S. 8. 6, that Lu·
canian boars were articularly prized. Martial mentions an Etrurian boat as
a great present he Eud received. Horace, in the next Satire (ver. 40), recom-
mends the Umbrian boar above the Laurentian, or those found in the mar-shy
land on the coast of Latium, in the neighborhood of Laurentum, about six-
teen miles from the mouth of the Tiber. The same cause that gave the Um-
brian boar its superiority would give value to the Lucanian: both were fed

235. werria] ‘Vertere’ is a word used for fishing: ‘to sweep the water-s?
See note on S. 4. 37.

237. tibi decies ,·] ‘Decies centena millia sestertium’: ten hundred thou-
sand sestertii, not much under nine thousand pounds. (See S. i. 3. 15.)

239. Filius Aesopi] AEsopuS, the actor, amassed great wealth. The name
of his son who inherited it was Clodius, which was the father's name, given
him perhaps as a freedman of some one belonging to the Clodia gens, Cae-
cilia Mctclla was the wife of P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, and was di-
vorced by him 13.c. 45, in consequence of her intrigues, chiefly with Dola-
bella, Cicero's son-in-laW, of whose rofligacy AEsop's son appears to have
been a artner. The mad foeak of (gladius is also (as is better known) re-

(ver. 86, n.). of the sons nothing is known.

2< 5. Luscinias] The second syllable is long3 the third coalesces with the
last (see i. 7. 30, n.). A dish of nightingales would eost a large sum and
afford little meat. Pliny mentions that AEsopm, the actor (see above, v.
239, n.)‚ on one occasion had a dish of sing-ing and talking birds, each of
which cost 6,ooo sestertii, and the whole dish 100,oo0, on which Pliny re-
marks, the man was worthy of his son, who melted the pearl and drank it. —
‘Impenso ' is nowhere else used absolutely for ‘impenso pretio,' which is a
common expression for a high price.

246. Saum creta, an carbone notandi 9] The distinction of days by white
and black marks has been mentioned, 0. i. 36. 10, n. Horace here applies
them to the distinction of character. The meaning of the sentence is, ‘ Are

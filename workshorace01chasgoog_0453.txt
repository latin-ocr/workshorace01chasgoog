SATIRE ·v·111.

01( ‚the outside of the city walls, iu front of Mons Esquilinus, lay the
Campus Esquilinus, in which was a. publio buriaI-ground for the rest of
the ple, and the Sestertium or place of execution for slaves an others of
the mer sort, whose bodies were left unbnried, for the dogs and vultures to
poey upon (see Epod. v. 100). This place, which must always have been a
public nuisanee and a source of malama, was given (as some say) by a decree
of the senate to Maecenas, or else purchased by him, cleared, drained, and
laid out in gaz-dm, in which he afterwards built a handsome house. (See C.
iil. 29. Epod. ix. 3. S. ii. 3. 309.) His example was afterwards followed
b -a member of the house of Lamia, in whose gardens Caligula was buried.
(guet. Calig. c. 59.) The following Satire was suggested ‘by a figure of
Priapus set up in Moecenas's gal-den. The god is represented as contrasting
the present etate of the ground with what it once was, by which a complimen‘t
is conveyed to Maecenas for ‘his public spirit in ridding the city of ,such a
nnisance. Priapus is also made to complain of the trouble he hae, in keep-

the pu ose of dragging in the woman whom floraco satirized under the Α
name οἳ) Canidia (v. 23, q.). The description is in some arts very like
that of the fifth Epode‚ an the two may have been written αξο
time.

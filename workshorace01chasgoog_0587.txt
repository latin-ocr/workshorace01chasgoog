ml verse from an unrhythmical, and so an indulgence they do not deservo ia
aeeorded to our poete. ‘ But am I on this account to take an manner of
liber-ties? Or, on the other hand, am 1 to suppose that eve one will see

‘ But, you will say, your fathers praised Plautus both for numbers and
his wit. Yes, the admired too patienti , not to say stupidly‚ both the one
and the other! oraee never has a word to say for Plautus, and he here
depreciaoes his wit as well as his versrfication. Both no doubt wanted polish3
and Horace does not scruple to insinuate (in the above place) that it was
only thro haste to get paid that he turned out his works so unfinished,
But his sq¹ e and his defeets were incidental to the period and manner of his

275. Iynotum tmqioec] The first representation of a play at Thespia was
in n. c. 535. The name τ· δία belo d, as observed above (on v. 220),
to the dithyrambic sougs of e Bacchicnffitivals, and these are of uncertain
origin, but of great annquity. The extent to which Thespis can be consid·
cred the author of tmgedy is, that he introduced an actor independent of the
chorus, who sustained various parts under the disguise of a linen mask. (See
v. 192, n.) This account, therefore, of the invention of traged at the vint-
age‚ the faces smeaoed with lees of wine, the wagon with w ‘ch Thespis
went round Attica, and so forth, may be rejected.

278. Post hunc personae pallaeque] Horace makes AEsch lus the inventor
of the mask and tragic dress (v. 215, τι). But there ean {te no doubt that
he who first· put an actor upon the stage, if hc, as most su pose, gave him
various parts to sustain, must have em Ιοὲεᾶ maske suite to the different
characters. There were symbolica! mas s or different ages and classeS‚ and
there were descriptive masks sor different persone, representing peculiarities
ffiwhich they would be known. The denvation of persona is unknown.

cius first introduced masks on the Roman stage about Β. c. 100. The‘

garrirent Horace means by ‘palla’ was an ‘upper dress, which had a train
to 1t (sce v, 215, n. . For the proper meaning of ‘ palla,’ see S. 1. 8. 23, n.

form of oomed , from which its name is derived, the song of the revellere

Between Susarion and the period of the old eomedy there were several distin-
guished writers, as Chionides, MagneS, Ecphantines‚ and others. The earli-
est writer of the old eomedy was Cratinus. See S. i. 4. 1, n.

288. Vel qui praetextas] ‘ Fabulae praetextae,' or ‘ praetextatae,' were
tragedias, as ‘togatae' were comedieS, with plots connected with Roman
>stol-ies and manners· (See Epp. ii. 1. 57, sqq.) The Greek *tragedies to
. ‘which ‘ praetextae ' were opposed, were called by the Romans ‘ crepidataess
‘ Docere ' is used as the Greeks used διδάσκέιν, for exhibiting aplay, because

the poet also trained the chorus as χοροδιδάσκαλος.

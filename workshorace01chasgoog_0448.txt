the ma'ority of boys learned little more,than the above, even in Horaee’s
time. en Cicero was a boy, the learning of the Twelve Tables formed a

necessat? part of education. Emer intercourse with Greece and the Greek
towns o Italy brought a more liberal class of studies to Rome, where Horace

reaching of thelr ⁴ paedagog1,' and afterwards (ull they assumed the ⁴ toga.
virilis: and in some cases longer) at the ⁴ ludi literarii,' private schools which
they attended as day scholars.

79. ,In nmque ut popula} ‘So far as one could see me in such a busy
qlft’ffli'custoe incer-ru ⁶ imus] The ‘paedagogus ' (⁴ custos 'h' whose office was
of late gnowth at me, and borrowed from Greece, had t e same functione

as the παιδαγωγός among the Greek3‚ and was a slave, as there. He was
continually about the boy's person, and went with him to his masters. This
task Horaee's father, who could have had but few slaveS, and had none whom
he could trust with such important dutieS, performed himself. Besides the
⁴ paedagogim,' as obser-ved above (v. 74, n.)‚ other slaves went with the boy,
to carry his bag, etc„ and to give him consequence.

86. pmetn-eoactor] The first of these functionaries was a crIer, either at
auctions (one of his dnties being to induce persons to attend and buy, see A.
Ρ. 419), or in courts of justine, or the public assemblies. There was a ‘prae-
co ' at all punishments and executione, to declare the crime of the offender
ἅβραι iv. 12, n.); also town-eriere, who cried lost property, as with us.

here were other kinds of criers. Which class Horace refers te, we cannot
tell. Nor is it. decided what class of ‘coactores' his father belonged to.
There were persons employed b the ⁴ publicani ' to collect the revenue, and
who were called ⁴ coactores! The person who collected the money bid at
an auction, was also a ⁴ coactor-,⁹ and, generally, persons employed to collect
money bore that title. It is probable that the ⁴ coactores ’ of the first class
made a good deal of money. Matthew the Apostle was one, and he was
rich. It is generally believed that the elder Horace belonged to the second
of the 'above elasseS, and some color is given to this by the associatiqn of the

‚ word with ⁴ praeeo! But Suetonius, or the author of Horace’s life attributed

to him, says that he was in the employ of the ⁴ publicani!

87. at hoc nunlci] ⁴ Hoc,' in the sense of ⁴ propter hoe‚’ ἐπὶ τούτω, is eom-
monly used by
mon m Caesar.

89. Nil me poeniteat sanum ⁴ I hope while 1 have my senses I may never
be ashamed? Horace uses t is mode of expression elsewhere, as in the last
Satire, v. 44, and S. ii. 3. 322.

90. dolo] ⁴ Dolus ' is used like ⁴ fraus ³ in C. i. 28. 30, for a fault generally:
‘dolo suo, ‘by his own fault!

93. Et vox et ratio :] ⁴ My language and my judgment.'

94. A emis annis] ⁴ From any given period.’ He means that, at all times
from his eradle upwardS, his father had been to him all that a father could
be. ⁴ Legere ad fastum,’ to ‘choose with reference. to ambition5 whatever

for her memory, as well as his father’s.

97. Fascibus et sellis] The ⁴ fasces ’ were bundles of sticks, with or without
an axe in the middle, which were carried before the consuls and praetors by
lictors. The ‘sella curulis’ was a chair ornamentcd with ivory, the use of
whgch during the republie was confined to the consuls, praetor-s, curule aediles,
an censore.

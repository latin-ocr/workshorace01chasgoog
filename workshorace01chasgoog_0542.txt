an expression like ‘sententia Catonis ' and others (see ii. 1. 72, n. . ‘Deli-

the Armenians, he having been for some time living in exile at Rome.
They put the reigning king, Artaxias», to death, and received Tigranes, be-
cause they had chosen to have him for their king. Nevertbeless, a coin was

EPISTLE XIII.

Tms letter professes to be written by Horace to one Vinius Asella, the
bearet of certain volumes of his to Augustus at Rome, Horace being probably
at his own estate. He writes as if he had given his friend particular and
anxious instructions, when he started, as to how he was to behave, and as if
this was to be sent after him, to overtake him on the read, in order to impress
those instructions upon his memory. It is probable that some sueh jokes
may have passed between Horace and his messenger when he started, and
that he amused himself afterwards by putting them into the form of this
Epistle. The person is assumed to be ignorant of the world, and therefore
liable to make mistakes in the execution of his mission3 to intrude at au
unseasonable time ; in the eagemess of his affection for Horace, to be too
officious ; to carry the books awkwardly, so as to draw attention, or to stop
in the streets in order to tell his curious friends what important business he

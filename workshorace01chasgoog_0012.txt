. without also making many enetnies. His Satires are full of allu-

sion's to the enmity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted, among other literary persons, with Virgil
and Varius, wh0, about three years after his return (Β. c. 39),
introduced him to MaecenaS, who was careful of receiving into his
circle a tribune of Brutus, and one whose writings utere of a kind
. that was new and unpopular. He accordingly saw nothing of
Horace for nine mdhths after his inffoduction to him. He then
sent sothim (Β. 0. 38), and from that time continued to‘be his
patron and warmest friend. ’ -
At his house, probabfy, Horace became intimate with Pollio,
and the many persons of consideration whose friendship he ap-
pears to have enjoyed. Through Maecena, also, it· is probable
, 2211*er was introduced to Augustus; but when that happened is
uncertain. In Β. c. 37, Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to
meet Μ. Antonius at Brundisium, and he took Horace with him
on that journey, of which a detailed account is given in the fifth
Satire of the first book. Horace appears to have pax-ted from the
rest of the company at Brundisium, and perhaps returned to
Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Introduction.)
Between this Journey and Β. c. 32, Horace received from his
friend the present of a small estate in the valley of the Digentia
(Idcenza), situated about thirty· four miles from Rome, and four-
teeffi from Tibur, m the Sabine country. of this property he
gives a description in his Epistle to Quintius (i. 16), and he
appears to have lived there a part of e³very year, and to have
been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), a muni·
cipium pei-hapa but not a place of any importance. During this
interval he continued to write Satires and Epodes, but also, it ap·
pears pmbable, some of the odes, which some years later he
published, and others which he did not publish. These composi-
tione, no doubt, were seen by his friends, and were pretty‘ well
known before any of them were collected for publication. The
first book of the Satires ‘ovas published probably ιιι Β.. o. 35, the
Epodes ιιι Β. c. 30, and the second book of Satires m the follow-
ing year, when Horace A'was about thirty· -five years old.

SATIRES.--BOOK 1.

SATIRE 1.

Tm pmfessed urpose of this satire, or that with which Horace seems to
have beguu, ma Ee thered from the first two lines. Discentent with the
condition that gro ence had assigned them ; disappointment with the po-
sition many years' labor, and perhaps dishonesty, have gained them ; envy of
their neighbors' circumstances, even if they be worse than their own3 dis-
satisfaction, in short, with what they have and are, and craving for something
they have not and are not, -these are features common to the great majority

of men. For this vice of discontent the Greeks had a comprehensive name,

of it, aud that not the most comprehensive (see notes on vv. 28. 108). Avarice
is the onl reason he assigns for the universal disemo, and any one will see
that here y he leaves many untouched who are as culpably resqess as the
avaricious, but not in their sordid way.

The Satire is put first in the order of this book, not as an introductiou (ef .
which it bears no signs), but because it is addressed to Maecenas.

These two are opposed, as effect and cause, the condition and that which
reduces it. ‘ Fors ' and ‘ ratio ' are opposed as that which a man cannot

as to affect the latter, as in those sentences which are coupled by ‘ nec ' and

animi maturus etes.’ And ‘ gravis ' is one of the commonest words
applied to old age, as may be gethered from Cicero’s treatise De Senect.;
and βαρύς is equally common in the same connection. Horace, in his own

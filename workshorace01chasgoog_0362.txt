ODE XXVII.

Tun subject of this Ode appears to be a journey to Greece (v. 19), proposed
by a lady of Horace's acquaintance, whom he pretends to deter from her pur-
pose, by reciting the dangers she will have to encounter, and the fate that
waits upon· female obstinacy, as illustrated by·the story os Europa, which

lua, C. iii. 5, a‘nd of Hypeimnestra, iiir 11), and Pindar took the gme libegtuy
with greater freedom. ·

storm: Ι know th'e dangers it portends. May they fall· upon my anem?
rather than on thee. It was thus Europa left her girhsh task‚ and crossed the -
sea by night, but seared not, till she stood on the shore of Crete. Then she
cricd out in anguish: “Alas! my father, a daughter's name I have aban-
doned 3 love is swallowcd up in madness. What an exchange is here !
Many deaths do I desei-ve to die. Am 1 awake, or is it a dream ’ἒ Was it
better to cross the sea than to gather young flowers at home‘! O that 1
might avenge myself on that monster, once too dearly loved! Shame on me
that I left my home3 shame that Ι delay to die. Let me go naked among
lions and perish by tigers, rather than waste away in a lingering death. ‘ Vile
girl l ' my father crica, ‘ why dost thou not die ’.ἱ Here thou mayest han by
thy irdle, οι· dash thee on the rocks, or into the stormy waves‚ unless {hou
wou ‹lst yield thyself a barbarian’s slave! '' Then came Venus and her son,
and laughed mischievously‚ and said: “ Cease th wrath, when the monster
shall come back to give thee thy revenge. What, nowest thou not that thou
art the sponse os Jove ’.ἱ Away with siglis. Bear thy noble destiny‚ for one
half the world shall take its name from thee.”

1. parrae What this bird was is not determined.

3. Ram acm-rens] The meaning of ‘ ravus ’ is not certain. Horace ap-
plies it to a wolf or a lion (Epod. xvi, 33), in the latter case imitating perhaps
Homer’s χαροποὶ λέοντες· (Odyss. xi. 611), for ‘ravus ¹ is said to be akin to
χαροπός. The wolf is represented as running down from the hills of Lanu-
vium, because that town was near the Appia Via leading to Brundisium,

' where Galatea. would embark.

6. Sa· per obliquum] The image of the snake shooting across the road re-
calls Jacob's prophecy in respect to his son Dan: “ Dan shall be a serpent by
the way3 an adder in the path that biteth the horsc's heelS, so that his ridel·
shall fall backwards '’ (Gen. xlix. 17).

7. eqo cui timebo} ‘ For my part, on behalf of her for whom 1 am anxious,
like a far-seeing augur, before that bird (the crow) which tells of the coming

storm shall go back to his stagnant pool, the croaking raven with my prayers

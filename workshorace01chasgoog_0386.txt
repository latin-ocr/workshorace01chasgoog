· Augustus, sufficiently describe the spirit of it, though its professed purpose is
to celebrate the part that Tiberius took, with Drusus, in thevictories over the
German tribes, It is probable that, whereas tho Ode for Drusus was written
soon after his victory, this was not written till Augustus'returned from Gaul,
two years afterwards.

Aneuunn'r.— With what honors shall we erpetuate thy virtues, Ο
mightiest of princes, whose strength the insolent indelici have felt? With
great slaughter Drusus cast them down from their heightS, and Tiberius
drove them before him, as the south wind drives the waveS, or the swolleu
Aufidus lays waste the corn‚- a scathless victory3 and thou didst lend thine
armieS, thy counseIS, and thine auspices. 'T was fifteen years from that day
when Alexandria opened her gates to thee, that Fortune brought this glory
to thine arms. All nations bow down to thee, from the east to -the west,
from the north to the south, Ο thou guardian of Italy and Rome i

4. fastos Aeternet,] As to ‘titulos,’ see S. i. 6. 17, ιι., and for ‘fastoS,’ see
Epp. ii. 1. 48, n. ‘ Aeternare’ is a word which had probably become almost
obsolete in Horace's time. It is not found in any other author, except in a
fragment of Varro. Many words used by Horace, and by no other extant
writer, were probably common enough before the age of Cicero. ‘ Habita·

biles oraS,’ like ἦ οἰκουμένη, so commonly used by Plutarch and the writers
‚of the New Testament, si nifies the Roman world.

10. Genauam] The Genauni were one of the southern tribes of Raetia,
lying between the lakes Verbanus (Maggiore) and Larius (Como), in the
modern Val d’ Agno. The Breuni were a small but warlike tribe, also occu·
pying part of Raetia. The character Horace gives of these tribes is that which
ιε given b all writers of the time. ‘ Implacidum ' is a word not found in any
writer ear ier than Horace. It is as likely that he made as that he found it:

an even exchange, i. e. of blood, he being ‘ sine clade victor ' (ν. 32). As to
the construction ‘ plus viee,' see C. i. 13. 20.

17. Spectandus— nantis] This seems imitated from the Greek idiom

θαυμαστὸς ὅσοις. ‘A noble sight, how in the strife of war he drove with
mighty slaughter those hearts devoted to a freeman's death?

20. Indomitos prope qualis] It may be observed, that the fourth verse of
the Aleaic stanza is frequently constructed with a noun and its adjective in
the first and last place, and corresponding in their last syllables. In this Ode
we have vv. 12, 16, 20, 36, 52, answering to this rule or habit. ‘Prope ' has
no particular force. Horace, whose ear was familiar with the language of tho
Greek tragediam, copied their σχεδόν τι (a common phrase in comparisons)
here and m other laces. The setting of the Pleiades, at the beginning of
November, was rec oned as the commencement of winter3 they therefore are
said to burst the clouds (‘scindere nubes '), which poured down rain upon the

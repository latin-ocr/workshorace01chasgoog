ἓὲιὲἓιῖιᾱᾱὲἳ ιίιῐιι ιῐέεζξῗτ to his personal ’characterfwhich Horace here wadlnly
defende, but which in after years was much blackened. There seems to be
no other way of accounting for the earnestness with which Horace declares
his friend's innocence of the vice of avarice, for instance, than to suppose
that fault-had been laid to his charge, as it was so freely after his death (see
Ingaedgaertyzvlim‘das] :rho lural ‘obliviones ’ is nowhere else used. ‘ Car-
pere' is used in the sense o gradually eonsuming, and has something like

that meaning here. ‘Lividus' is akin to the Greek πελιδνός, and to the
Latin ‘luridus’ (C. iii. 4. 74, n.). It means ‘dark,' and is commonly as-
sociated with envy, which connects it with oblivion caused by envy: -Horace

“ Cato multarum rerum usum habebat” (Cic. de Am. ii. 6) expresses the
same kind of experience. ‘ Rectus ’ means ‘erect,' not stoopin or bowed
down, as “Fana deos habuere rectos '⁹ (C. iv. 4. 48). See Ennius,

- 39. G non unias anna] Compare C. iii. 2. 19. Lollius was consul,

Β. c. 21, bnt orace says that an npright ‘judex ' is always on a level with

the highest magistrates3 and such ever was Lollius, besieged like others with

temptations to corruption, but resistin them all, and so overeoming the

ffle‘mieslwm' encompassed him, and de ivering himself by his virtue from
eir ca ammes.

41. Judex honestum] That it should be a matter of great merit and diffi-
culty to maintain the character of an unoorrnpt judex, does not say much
for the honesty of those who exercised the functione of jnrors. The corrup-.
tion of the senator-ian body led to the jndicial power bemg transferred from
them to the equites, but they in their turn were found so corrupt that it was
given back to the senatores, and afterwards the judiees were selected from
both orders. See S. i. 4. 123, n. -

44. Emicuit} ‘ Thmngh hostile crowds hath carr-led safe his arms victo-
rious.’ ‘ Ex licare' ¹seems to correspond with ‘expedire’ in C. iv. 4. 76.

52. Non ilE—timidus] ‘ He fears disgraoe worse than death, —not sear-
ful he to die for his country,' i. e. but he is not fearfnl. See C. iii. 19. 2 ;
“ Codrus pro patria non timidus mori.” See also C. iii. 2. 13, n.

 

’ ODE X.

Lmnnmus is· a merely poetical personage, and probably Horace com·
posed this Ode with a Greek original before hun or 111 his mind.

Austranum. — Cruel and lovel boy; when the down shall have passed
upon th cheek, and thy flowing ocks have fallen, and thy soft complexion
vanishe , thou shalt look in the glass‚ and say, “ Why did 1 not, as a boy,
fgel as I do now ; or why, with these feelings‚ have I not the beauty I had
t en ’.ἱ ”

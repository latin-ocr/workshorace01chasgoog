richer lovers to himself, but now the young Lyciscus has caught his hear-t,
and nothing but some new love can deliver him from the snare. The poet
ffidvaeeslsegnhizfriend Pettius, as one who had before been his confidant and

maurinum. — Pettius, I am so smitten with the heavy hand of love, who
makes me above others his vicum, that I cannot write as I used. 'T is two
years since I gave up Inachia. Ah! what a by—word Ι was then! How Ι
sighed in company and poured out my complaints to thee, when wine had
opened my heart! “ Has the or man's wit no chance against the rich
man’s purse'3 My wrath is kin e'd : 1 cast my modest and my sighs to the
winds; Ι will contend with such rivals no more.” T us did I boast ; but
my feet carried me still to her cruel door. And nosv, boasting that Ι have no
woman to sear, Lyciscae has caught my heart3 nor can counsel or raillery
deliver me, nor aught but some new flame.

1. Petti,] This name is not found elsewhere. It may nevertheless be a
ffialdffme' though it seems only to be introduced to give an air of reality to

e e.

3. me praeter munes expetit] ‘ Me ’ is governed hy ‘expetit‚' not hy ‘urere-³
Z‘LExpetit— urere ³ is a Greek construction ς ‘ quem urat ’ is the regular

atin. .

4. in pueris] This use of ‘in’ is not very common. It occurs Ov. Met.
iv. 234: “ Neque enim moderatus in illa Solis amor fuerat.’'

6. Inachia] This is another of those names from the Greek which Horace
invariably adopts in his merely poetical compositions. See Introduction.

honorem decutit] This expression is used by virgil, who either borrowed
it from Horace, or from some common original (Georg. ii. 404) : “ Frigidus
fg sileis Aquilo decussit honorem.'’ See C. 1. 17. 16 : ‘⁶ Ruris honorum opu-

nta. '

8. Fabula] Epp. i. 13. 9: “Fabula fias.'’ He means he was the talk 01
the town. ‘Arguit’ (v. lo) is the reterperfect tense.

11. Contrane] ‘ Can it be that e honest genius of the poor man has no
influence against gold ’ἐ ’ ‘ Ne ’ might be omitted, but then it would be a
mere exclamation, ‘ To think that,’ cte. ,

12. ᾳρρῖοναηε This word is not found elsewhere, except in Seneca.

· 13. mveroeun us dats] When Horace means to discourage brawling over v

wine, he calls Bacchus ‘verecundus ’ (C. i. 27. 3). The best works of art
represent this god as young and effeminately beautiful, with long hair, like
Apollo, as the emblem of eternal outh. It is a coarse modern notion to
re resent him as a jolly round-face boy, or a drunken sot. This character
be ongs to SilenuS‚ who is always drunk.

15. Quodsi meis] ‘ But now that in my heart is boiling wrath so free that
it doth scatter to the winds these thankless remedies that cure not my sad
wound‚ my modesty removed shall cease to strive with rivale not mine
equals.' He means to say, that his wrath has ot the better of his love and
modesty3 and he will cast his complaints and is shyness to the winds‚ and
ceasc to contend with rivals that are unworthy of him. ‘ Fomenta ' means
siglis and complainings with 'which grief is sought to be relieved. ‘Libera
bilis’ is like (Epod. iv. lo) “liberrima indignatio.” ‘ Imparibus ’ signifies
his rivals who are beneath him in mind, though his betters in fortune. ⁴ De-
sinet certare summotus pudor’ is equivalent to ‘ desinam certare summoto
pudore.' ‘ Imparibus ’ is the vdative case. See C. i. 1. 15, 11. ‘ Inaestuo ’ is
not used elsewhere, but Horace is free in his use of prepositions in composi-
tion, after the manner of the Greeks.

19. palam laudaveram] ‘Palam’ is used both as an adverb and a prep-

osition„ ‘Laudaveram ³ is equivalent to ‘ jactaverant?

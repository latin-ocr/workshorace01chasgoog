for such an intimate friend, if he could have ventured to do so; but the chax·-
acter of Tiberius did not admit of warmth‚¹ and he would not have responded
to any very earnest eulogy. Horace therefore satisfies himself with merely
naming his friend, and excusing his own boldness in doing so.

1. nimirum] ‘ Of course‚’ it would be strange if it were otherwise. Horace
sometimes uses the word seriously‚ sometimes ironically‚ as in S. ii. 2. 106;
3. 120. He says, ‘ Of course Septimius knows my influence with you better
than an body else does (‘ unuS,' see S. ii. 6. 57, n.)‚ and better than I do my·
sels, an thinks that I stand to you in the relation of an intimate friend, or
he would not press me for an introduction.’ There is about the same amount
of ironical meaning in ‘scilicet’ (v. 3) as in ‘nimirum.’ ‘Tradere’ is the
usual word for introductions. (S. i. 9. 47.)

4. Diqnum mente domoque] Tacitus sa s of TiberiuS, that his genuine char-
acter did not come out fully till after t e fall of Sejanus„ At this time he
was about twenty-two years of , but even now was reserved and unpleas-

, ant in his manners, so much so t at even Augustus could hardly be cheerful

in his eompan . Horace speaks well of him, not only here, when he is writ-
ing to himselF, but in Eppkii. 2. 1, wgtten rlobtzbly at a lakter time, to his

favor. ‘Domo ' means his family. Tiberius was the son of Τ. Claudius
Nero, and the Nerones belonged to the patrician gens Claudia, whicli num-
bered many consuls and other high magistrates, from the first establishment
of the family in B. c. 504. The were of Sabine origin.

5. Munere cumsunyi] This p rase is like ‘ officium facio' below (Epp. 17.
21). It means to discharge the duties of fricndship, but generally expresses
the relation of an inferior to one above him in rank, and sometimes is used
in a bad sense, to signify servility. ·

6. wldae'us] This comparative occurs again, in A. P. 321 : “valdius ob-
lectat populum.’' ·

11. Frontis ad urbanae descendi praetutia] ‘ Urbanae frontis ’ seems to
mean an ‘impudent ‚frontss sluch as 0ηὲ who had lsseembreg‘iX citieg might

he has resolved to win the crown or p'rize of impudence, or something of that

in Greek. It occurs m C. iii. 13. 13 t “ Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium.”

EPISTLE X„

Tms Epistle is addressed t'o Fuscus Aristium-whose name ap ars in C. i.

225 S. i. 9, 61 ; 10. 83. For such particulare as can be stated a out him, see ,

the Introduction to the above Ode. It appears that his habits inclined him
to a town life. He was making money in some way, and he was associated
with all Horace's literary and other friends, Horace praises the freedom,
the natural beandas, and the healthiness of the country, and shows that they
93 natural to men’s tastes, from the attempts they make to get trees in their
towwhouses, and a prospect over the fields. He follows this up with a few
miscellaneons remarks on the pursuit of wealth‚ how it blinds the eyes to the
distinction between truth ἱ’ῗῐιᾱ falsehood‚ and how prosperity only makes ad-

15. nmriuo Rore] ‘ Rosmarinus ' is the name of a plant which grows wild
in war-mer climates than ours. We call it rosemary, after the Latin name,
which the ancients supposed to be composed of ‘ ros ’ and ‘ marinum,’ ‘ sea·

ODE XXIV. ,

Tms Ode is of the same class, and was probably written about the same
time as the early ones of the third book, i. e. about A. n. c. 728. It deals with
the licentious abuses of the times, and points indirectly to Augustus as the
real reformer of them, as in the second Ode of the first book. The variety of
images and illustrations in this Ode is very remarkable, and they are particu-
larly well choscn and original. There is none that exhibits Horace’s peculias
style more completely than this does,

Amnum· - Let a man be as rich and extravagant as he may, yet, when
Pate overtakes him, sear and death will seize him. The wandering tribes of ⁸
the North —with their free plains and toils equally shared, where step-mothcrs
, are kind and wives are obedient and chaste, and where crime meets with its
reward — are happier than we are, He who would gain a name sor future
times (for merit is only recognized after death), let him put a check upon the
licentiousness of the age. Of what use is it to com lain, if crime goes un-
punished 2 Of what use are laws without morals ’.ἱ e are running eve ·
where in quest of money, urged on b the shame of poverty. If we real y
- repent,·let us give our gold to the go a, or cast it into the sea, eradicate the
seeds of avarice, and strengthen our minds with nobler pursuits. Our youth
are idle : their fathers lay up wealth by fraud : for, let riches increase as they
will, they always fall short of men's desires.

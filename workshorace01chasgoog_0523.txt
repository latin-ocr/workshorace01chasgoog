it was about3 but Horace attributes it to youthful heat and ignorance of the
world. He likens them to unbroke hor-see, and tells them that they ought to
make it up, and that when the come home they will find the fatted calf
ready for sacrifice. Compare . i. 36. written on the return of Numida. It

EPISTLE IV.

, Tms Epistle is addressed to Albius Tibullus, the poet, to whom also C.
i. 33 is written. The letter only professes to be one to inquire after Tibul-
lus3 but occasion is taken to commend his fortunes and himself, and to bid
him live every day as isit were the last. Horace writes to his friend (proba-
bly from Rome) at his place near Pedum, a town of Latium, not far from
Praeneste. There Tibullus had ‚a good estate, inherited from his father,
which, before his death, ho appears by some means to have diminished.
That his losses must have occurred after this Epistle was written, we may
ffrhaps infer from v. 7. He lived chiefly on his estate, in the quiet pursuits
orace here supposes him to bc engaged in; though immediately after the
battle of Actium he accompauicd Messalla into Gaul, and was absent about
a year, which, as far as we know, comprised all his active life. Horace,
among other blessingS, assigns him good health; nevcrthelcss he died young.
It appears that, while many disparaged Horace's writings, Tibullus judgcd
them kindly‚ and the affection the two poets bore onc another cannot bc mis·
taken. Tibullus was probably ten or twelvc years younger than Horace.
-Tibullus died the same year with Virgil (n. 0. 20), or very soon after.

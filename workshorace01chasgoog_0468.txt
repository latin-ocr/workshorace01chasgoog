SATIRE ΙΙ.

property was taken from him and made over to ono of the veteran soldiem,
named Umbrenus (v. 133), and that he afterwards rented, as ‘ colonuS‚' a
farm on that estate which was once his own. This tmnsfer took place, in all
probability, when the troops returned to Italy after the battle of Philippi,
Β. c. 42, at which time (among ‘several other districts) the Venusinus ager
was distributed among the soldiers. It has been supposed that Horace visit-
ed his native place, and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella, on his return
from Brundisium. (See Introduction to S. i. 5, sub fin.) The old man, un-
changed by the reverses of fortune, industrious and uncomplaining, exhorting
his sons to frugality and contentment, is a pleasant picture, and helps by
contrast to illustrate the gluttonous and luxurious habits of the city.

3. abnormis sapiens, crassaque Miner-vad A man wise without mle, and of
plain mother wit. Cicero (Dc Amicit. c. 5) uses the expression “ agamus
pingui Minerva '' as a proverbial one. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom,
and ‘ crassa Minerva ' therefore meane, proverbially‚ a coarse kind of wisdom.

4. inter lances mensasque nitentes] The wealthy Romans had already learned
to fill their rooms with costly farnitum, and to make a display of their plate,
whether in the shape of uscsul or ornamental vessels. Very much of the

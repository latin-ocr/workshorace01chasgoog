SATIRE IV.

Tms Satire is an essay on good living, put in the form of precepts deliv-
ered to Horace at second hand by one Catius, who professes to have received
them from some sag-e more learned in the art, whom he does not name.
Horace meets him accidentally, as he is h ‘ng away from the Professor's
lecture, to think over what he had learnt, an to store it in his mind. Catius
recites what he has heard, from memory or from notes, and enters without
preface upon the question of the first course. The Professor may be sup-
posed to have carried his hearers throuffh an entire dinner, “ ab ovo usque
ad mala '⁹ (see S. i. 3. 6, n.). Catius on y gives the heads of the lecture and
one or two of the sage's reflections. The precepts he delivers inflame Hor-
ace with a desire to see and hear the great man himself, and he prays Catius
to introduce him. It ma be that Horace had some third person iu his eye,
but we have no means of nowing who it was. If it be se, there were those,
no doubt, who would understand the allusion at the time. As to the man
‘Catius himself, he appears to have been a well-known follower of the Epicu-
rean school, but he must have been dead many years before this Satire was
written. Probably, therefore, Horace only introduces his name as a handle
for ridiculing the Epicureans. ·

here is equivalent to ‘ sapor? y Horace should make Catius say that
long eggs were more white than round once, or what is gained by the white-
ness of an egg, or by its containing a male rather thau a female chicken, is
not clear. He puts any nonsense‚ it appear-S, into the man's mouth. ‘1²0-
nere ' is to put upon the table, as ‘ posito pavone ' (S. ii. 2. 23). The notion
that from long eggs cocks were hatched‚ and from round, heus, appears to
have been a vulgar error. ‘ Callosa ' signifies ‘tough,' and belongs in sense,
though not in construction, to the yolk.

cipleS, u'nder the fancil'ulnotion that in eating them thefmight be devouring
their own flesh and blood. Hence the expression ‘ cognata,’ and this is the

allusion in Ep . i. 12. 21 : “ seu porrum et caepe trucidas.’' As to Horaee's
vegetable mea s, see S. i. 6. 115.

66. Ante Larem proprium See note on Epod. ii. 66. ‘Libatis dapibus'

means that the master and is friends (‘ meique ³) dined lightly‚ and left the ·

greater part of the dishes to his slaves. The master, in this instance, as well
as his slaves, dined in the ‘atrium,' where the images of the Lares were

laced. ‘Libere' is to touch lightl . See Aen. v. 91: “inter pateras et
tssmdpocm? spa-perlis Libavitque dapes} The distribution of the remains of

e muer ο ο s aves was a ma er ο course. -

69. Leyibas insania] See S. 2. 123, n. One of the strictest laws of a ban-
quet directed by a presiding symposiarch, would have reference to the regn-
lation of the quantity of wine to be drunk by each guest at each round. -
Horace’s notion of liberty here is to be able to drink as much or as little as
he pleased, which is expressed by ‘inaequales calicesll

70. uvescit] ‘ Uvescere ' does not occur elsewhere, but it corresponds with
Horaee’s word ‘uvidus,’ C. ii. 19. 18, and iv. 5. 39.

72. Nec male necne Lepos saltet ,Ἀ Mpos was a ‘pantomimus ’ who was so
named from the ce with which e performed his part, as the name implieS.
The business of t e ‘mimi,' as of the ‘mimae,’ was to recite poetry, as well as
to act parts in the farces that bore the same name (S. i. 10. 6, n.). The
word ‘saltare' was applied to all pantomimic acting, and the motion of the
limbs in dumb show. See S. i. 5. 63, where Messius calls upon Sarmentus to
act Polyphemus, — “ Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat,” where ‘ salta-
ret' is equivsslent to2‘m3Jctur' in “Nunc Satyrum nunc pastorem Cyclopa
movetur '’ . ii. . . .

75. usus §ve-{ffmneJ Cice›ro makes Laelius indignantly deny the doctrine
that makes utility the foundation of friendship‚ and he says, with much truth
and dclicacy, “ non enim tam utilitas parta per amicum quam amici amor

76. natura boni summumque] This subject} is discussed at large in Cicero's
treatise ‘ De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,' and was a commonplace in
Horaoe’s day, as it has⁸ been in all ages. ‘ Summum ' represents the Greek
τέλος, ‘the end proposed.' -

77. Cervius] This was an old neighbor of Horace's. There is not the
smallest clew to his history or to that of Arellius, wh0, however, must have
been a rich man and careful about his money.

79. Olim] ‘ Once upon a time ’ : a common way of beginning a story that
does not profess to be true. ·

82. attentus] This is a common word for what we should call ‘close'
geel Epp. i. 7. 91 ; ii. 1. 172. ‘ Ut tamen' means ‘ita tamen ut! Compare

84. nec lonyae invidit avenae‚] This construction is Greek: φθονεῖν τίνα’
’ τινος. The Latin construction is with the accusative and dative, as S. i. 6.
49; Epp. i. 14. 41'. The ‘avena’ here is the cultivated oat, and ‘longae'
describes the size of its grain. The wild-oat Vir-gil distinguishes from this
by the epithet ‘sterilis ’ (G. i. 153), and couples it with the ‘lolium,' or tare,
with which the host on this occasion satisfied himself.

87. male] This goes with ‘tangentis,' and is equivalent to ‘ vix!

89. Esset ador See C. iv. 4. 41, n.

93. mihi crede, These words are parenthetical, as Ovid (Am. ii. 2. 9):
“ Si sapis, ο custos, odium, mihi crede, mereri Desine.'' The language that
follows is very like that of Hercules in the Alcestis of Euripides (782,

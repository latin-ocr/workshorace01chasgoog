2. rhetor eomes Heliodorus,] Horace jocularly exaggerates the merits of
this Greek. Nothing is known of him from other sources. Appii Forum
was thirt -nine miles from Rome, and was so called 'by Appius Claudius,
surnan'iedv Caecus, who in his censorship (A. U. c. 441) constructed the Via
Appia and the great aqueduct which bore his name. Some ruins of this
town are said by Walekenaer still to exist. Its modern name is Borgo
Lung0. The participle ‘ differtus ' means ‘ fu11‚’ and is foimed as from ‘ dif-
fercio,' which verb is not found. ‘Differtus' occurs below (Epp. i. 6. 59).
‘Malignis ' belongs to ‘cauponibus’ in the same sense as ‘perfidus’ (S 1. ι
29). ⁶ Nautae ' were the boatmen who plied on the canal mentioned below
(v. 7, n.). It was to Appii Forum that some of the Christians, when they
heard of St. Paul’s approach, went, from Rome, to meet him. Others met him
at a place called Tres Tabernae (La Caistena), which was about seven miles
from Aricia, and sixteen from Appii Forum. Horace must have assed
through this town without stopping. It was a well7known place, and m it
a Christian bishop took his title, “ Felix a Tribus Tabernis.'’

5. Hoc iter] i. e. the journey from Rome to Appii Forum, which was
usually made in one day, they took two to accomplish. ⁴ Praecinctus ’ is op-

posed to ‘ discinctus,' and means ‘ one well gir& εὔζωνος, and ready for active
exertiofi, running, etc. Horace uses the word more literally, S. ii. 8. 70:
“ ut ornnes Praecincti recte pueri comptique ministrent.’' The Asiatics tuck
up in their girdles their long garments, when they are pre aring to run or
walk quick. Hence such expressions as we meet with in cripture, “ Gird
up 1{Ille loins of your mind.'’ ‘ SuccinctuS,' ‘tucked up‚' is the more usual
wo .

6. minus est yravis Appia tardes] Horace means, that the Via Appia was
less fatiguing to the slow traveller than to the quick 3 that it was a rough
mad, over which the slower you went, the less unpleasant was the journey.
This road was constructed with a foundation of large squared blocks of basal-
tic stone, over which was laid a coating of gravel, until the Emperors Nerva
and TraJan laid it with silex, according to an inscription found on a mile-
stone in the neighborhood of Forum Appii. Horace s eaks elsewhere of the
travellcr “qui Romam Capua petit imbre lutoque A spersus'' (E p. i. ll.
11). In one of the verses of the Satire of Lucilius, mentioned in t e Intro-
duction, he sayS‚ “ Praeterea omne iter est labosum atque lutosum.’'
“ 7. Hic eyo propter aquam, At Appii Forum they were to embark at night
in a boat that was to carry t em by canal to Tarracina. A party were wait- χ
ing at the-same inn to go with them, and Horace waited with impatience till 1
they had done supper. These he means by ‘ comites? This canal was con· ²

‘ structed by Augustus. There are still traces of it to be seen. It was nine-

teen miles long, and was called in' consequence Decennovium. The road
may have been defective hereabouts, as it was the general practice of travel-
lers to exchange it for the canai, and to make the journcy by night.

9. ιΙαηι nox inducere tem’s] This is a parody of the heroic style, unless it
be taken from some poet, as Ennius

12. Huc appelle l] “ Put in here, and take us on board ! '' eries a servant.
“ How many more ‘3 — you ’ll swamp the boat l ’⁹ says another to the boat-
man, who wants to get as many as he can. The bank is crowded ; the pas-
sengers all want to be attended to at once. The collection of the fare and
putting-to the mule being accomplished, Horace goes on board. The boat
starts, and he lies down to sleep, disturbed much by the mosquitos and the
croaking of frogs. The boatman and one of the passengers‚ half drunk, sing
songs till the one drops off to sleep, and the other, havin a mind to do the
same, stops the boat, turns the mule out to gram, lays ' elf down, and

43. Sacrum vetustis] The lire-place was sacred to the Lares. The wood
must be old that it might not smoke, like that which plagued the travellers at
Trevicum (S. i. 5. 80). The ‘focus’ was either a fixture of stone or brick,
in which case it was synonymous with ‘ caminus: or it was movable and
made of bronze, and thenit was usually called ‘ foculus? In either case it
was a wide and shallow receptacle for wood or charmel, the smoke of which
found its wa out by apel-tures at the top of the room, or, in some rare in-
stanees, by c imneys.

‘ Sub,3 with the accusative case, in phrases of time signifies ‘immediately
after! ‘ Sub adventum viri ' is not ‘in anticipation of her husband’s arrival ’ ;
but ‘ as soon as he has made his appearance-‚³ wear-y with his day's work, she

uts wood on the fire and gets up a cheerful blaze. But in the phrases “ sub
faerimosa funera” (C. i. 8. 14), “sub ipsum funus '' (C. ii. 18. 18), ‘sub’
can only mean close upon, but before the event.

47. horna—dolio] Poor wine of that year, which had not been bottled for
keeping, but was drunk direct from the ‘ dolium.' Like the other parts of
this description, this is meant to convey the notion of primitive simplieity.
The wine of the year is generally drunk now, in and about Rome.

48. inemptas] Georg. iv. 132 ‘z‘gmque revertens

Nocte domum dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis.”
As to the o sters of the lacus Lucrinae, see S. ii. 4. 32.

50. rhen us] See S. ii. 2. 42, n. The ‘ scams,' whatever that fish may be
(for it is not certain), is said by Pliny to have abounded most in the Carpa-
thian Sea. The stom, therefore, must come from the east that should drive
it to thecoast of Italy. Ι

51. imonata] This participle occurs nowhere else in extant writer-33 but
it is not likely Horace invented it. It represents the noise of the wind, rather
than the thunder of the clouds, as Virgil (Georg. i. 371) says, “ Eurique Ze—
phyrique tonat domu8.''

53. Afra avis] What bird is meant we cannot tell. The Greeks called

“ them peheaypnffias. Martial (iii. 58. 15). speaks of “ Numidicae guttatae,”
speckled,' w ich seems to be the same bird, and answers to the appearance
of the guinea-fowl. The ‘ attagen ' is usually said to be the moer-sowi. Mar-

tial says it was one of their most delicious birds (xiii. 61). It is repeatedly
mentioned by Aristophanes. Aristotle, in his History of Animula, numbers

it among κονιστικοὶ ὅ νιθες, birds which do not fly high.

57. Aut herba lapat i] Both the ‘lapathus ’ and the ‘ malva ’ were gently
purgative. See Sat. ii. 4. 29. ·

59. caesa Terminalibus,] The Terminalia took lace in the early spring
(23 Februa ), about the time of lambing, and lam were offered to Termi-
nus, the ‚who protected boundaries. Plutarch says that sheep nescued
from the jaws of the wolf were thought to be better ssavored than others.
The thrifty would eat them for economy. That is the idea Horace means to
conve .

Ghzet juvat] See ν. 19, “ut udet.”

65. vernas, ditis mmm domus, ⁴ Verna ’ was a slave born on the owner's
estate. There was a hearth near which the images of the Lares were placed,
in the centre of the ‘atrium,' the entrance-roem, and round it the slaves had
their supper. ‘ Renidentes ’ means shining by the light of the fire.

67. finer-ator Alphius] A usurer of this name is mentioned by Columella,
as an authority on the subject of bad debts. ‘ Redigere ’ is the technieal word
for getting in money out on loan, and ‘ ponere ¹ for putting it out, as κατα-
βάλλειν, βάλλειν, τιθέναι. The settling days at Rome were the Kalends,
Nones, and Ides. Horace says that Alphius delivered the foregoing speech
when he had made up his mind to turn farmer immediately, an'd that with

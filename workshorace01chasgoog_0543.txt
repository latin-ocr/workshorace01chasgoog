2. siquam saturnina] The number of volumes would dcffigd u n the
number of books into which the work was divided, as each k, i it was
not very long, would be rolled on one stick. (See Epod. 14. 8, n.) Round

Valeria, which passed very near the valley of the Digentia.

14. ylomus furtivae Pyrrhia lanae‚] Pyrrhia is said to be the name of a
slave in a lay of Titinius, who stole some wool, and carried it away so clum-
sily that s e was detected. Titinius was a writer of comedies who lived
before Terence. Pyrrhia is formed from Pyrrha, the name of a town in
Lesbos, like Lesbia, Delia, &c ‘ Glomus ' is the singular number and
neuter nder. It means a clew or ball of wool.

15. ccum pileolo soleas] The notion here is of a person of humble sta-
tion invited to the table of a great man of his own tribe, who perhaps wanted
his vote and influence. Having no slave to can-y them for him, as was usual,
he comes with his cap and slippers under his arm in an awkward manner,
not being accustomed to the ways of fine houses. ‘ Pileus ' was a skull-cap,
made of felt, and worn at night οι· ἰιι bad westher. The man would bring
it with him, to wear on his way home from the dinuer—party. The ‘solea’
wSas ιὲιο slipper‚ worn in the house, as ‘calceus ' was the walking shoe.

entreat you to tell them your business, prees on.'’ Horace, by way of keep-

ing up the joke, supposes his messenger ω arrive, hot from his journey, and

{o be besieged by inquisitive people, wanting to know what 'brings him to
me.

19. eave ne titubes] This is perhaps another jocular allusion to his name,
and, as an ass stumbling mi ht chance to break what he was carrying, he
adds, ‘ mandataque frangas! n plain prose it means, ‘ 'Pake care you make
no mistake, nor neglect to deliret your charge’

 

EPISTLE XIV.

Holmon appears to have had a discontented ‘ villicus,' or steward of his
property, whom he had promoted to that post from having been originally
one of the lower sort of slaves in the town establishment. While m that
position, he sighed for what he thought must .b⁰ the superior freedom of the

cess to the tavern and cook-shop, forgetting, as is common, the vexations that
had made him long for deliverance before. This man’s discontent suggested
to Horace this Epistle. It is such only in form, for we are not to suppose
it was ever sent to the villicus, Horace means to describe his own feelings

7. Intactas} See C. iii. 24. 1. What Horace means to say is, “ The blood
that has been spilt in these civil wars has been shed, not for the destruction
of Carthage, as in the war that Scipio led, or that the Briton might be led in
chains, as he was by Julius Caesar, but for the destruction of Rome herself.”

13. vis aeriam] This seems to be an absolute expression (not comparative

EPODE IX.

Tne date of this Ode is not to be mistaken. It was written when the news
ol* Actium was fresh, in September, B. c. 31, immediately before the 37th of
the first book. It is addressed to Maecenas, who is called upon to celebrate
Eigh a feast at bis new house the victory of Augustae, which is described as

Anemnwr. — When shall we drink under thy tall roof, Maeeenas, to
Caesar the conqueror, as late we did when the son of Neptune lost his fleet
and fied, — he who threatened us all with the chains his slaves had worn ’Ξ
Will our sons believe it ’ἒ Romans have sold themselves to serve a woman
and her eunuchs, and the luxurious gauze hath {mered among the standai-ds
of war! But their allies desei-ted to our side, and their ships sknlked from
the fight- Io Triumphe! bring forth the lden chariot and the sacrifice.
So great a conqueror never came from rica before. The enemy hath
changed his purple for mourning, and hath fled to Crete or the Syrtes, οι·
knoweth not whither to fly. Bigger cape, boy, — Chian, or Lesbiam, or Cae-
ouban, — we will drown our old anxieties for Caesar in wine.

· 3. sub alta— domm] This was the house built by Maeoenas on the Campus

Esquilinus. See Introdsgession to s. i. ε.

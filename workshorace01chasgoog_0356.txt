1. Ο nata meeum] Horace was born Β. c. 65, when L. Manlius Torquatus
and L. Aurelius Cotta were consuls, in which year the amphora addressed is
here said to have been filled. (See above, C. iii. 8. 12, n.) ‘ Testa‚’ which
signifies properly any,earthen yesseI, was used to express the-“- dolium ' as

for the meaning ιε to be derived from its connection with ‘ facilem somnum.’

5. Quocunque — nomine ‘ on whatever account! ⁴ Nomen ' si ifies an
entry in an account (see pp. ii. 1. 105, n.). The derived sense o the word

with an infinitivo. In' Horace’s day and by Cicero it was used only with the
relative pronoun in construction with a verb. ‘ Languidiora ’ corresponds to
‘languescit mihi ' above (C. iii. 16. 35). ,

9. madet] ‘is steeped in.' This word would hardly have been used. for
‘imbuitur ’ in this sense on any other occasion.

11. Narratur et prisci Catum This is the Cato mentioned on C. ii. 15. 11.
His being fond of wine is most ikel an invention of Horace's.

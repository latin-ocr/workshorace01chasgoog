' 163. Sublimis cupidum] ‘Soaring and ambitione!

172. spe hayus, ‘Slow to hope.' ‘Avidus fut-urt' means ‘eager to live
longer,' or ‘ gree y of life? Both these expressions are unusual.

175. Multa serunt anni} See C. ii. 5. 14, n., and Epp. ii. 2. 55. The re-
mark seems to be drawn
preceding verses. It has not much otherwise to do with the subject.

178. adjunctis aevoque morabimur apua] Both ‘adjunctis' and ‘apffl’ go
with ‘ aevo,' ‘ we shall dwell upon that which attaches and is fitted to the age

we have in hand.’

180. Seynius irritant animos] When Candaules proposes to exhibit his
wife’s beauty to Gyges, Herodotus (i. 8) makes him say ὦτα γὰρ τυγχάνει
ἀνθρώποισι ἐόντα· ἀπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν, and Seneca (Epp. vi.) has a like
saying, “ Homines amplius oculis quam auribus credunt.''

184. facundia praesensi An eyewitness‚ who tells the s ctators what he
lpas seen, and does itin t e flow of a long, set speech. T is is the part of
the messe rs and heralds, of which one or more appears in every Greek
tragedy. t{ziraesens' means ‘before the audienee.'

186. coquat exta nefizrius Atreus‚] See C. i. 6. 8, n. ; 'and as to Procne, see
C. iv. 12. 5, n. Short fragments of the Atreus of Sophocles and Cadmus of
Euripides are extant. The story of Cadmus and his wife Harmonia changed
into snakes is told by Ovid (Met. iv. 563, sqq.). Such barbarities and mirac*
iilous changes, Horace sayS‚ may answer in nai-ration, but if represented on
the stage ate both incredible and disgusting. He may have had some in-
stance of this kind in view. See C. i. 6. 8, n.; ii. 1. 10, n.; S. i. 10. 42, n.

191. nec deus intersit] It was a reproach against the tragediam, that, ‘arhen
the‘y did not know how to bring their plot to a close, the had reeourse to a
god. The gods were introduced on a platform above. enee the proverb,
“Deus ex machina,” for an summat· way of winding np a plot, or extri-
¹cassng otrie's self from a diffi'zulty. ‘ gignas vindice’ means worthy of such

n rven ion.

192. nec quarta loqui persona laboret] Thespis first introduced a single
actor ou the stage, who perhaps told a story and served to relieve the chorus.
AEschylus introduced a second, and so brought regular dialogus into the
drama. Sophocles added a third, and this number was rare} if ever ex-
cecded. (See Epp. i. 18. 14, n.) The Romans obser-ved no suc restrictiori,
but it must always be the case, if more than three actor-s are on the stage at
once, that some of them can have but little to say.

. 193. Actoris partes chorus] The chorus should sustain in its place, and te
the best of its power, the part of an actor-3 that is, instead of singing what is
irrelevant to the plot, it ought to carry on the aetion. ‘ Officiumque virile
defendat’ is a way of ex ressing, ‘it must sustain a strennuus paul or ‘do
its duty strenuonsly! Ifomce uses the expression ‘ defendente vicem ' in the
Βαῗὶξὸῗθῖἱῗεθ ἐοῗήειῂιιεὲαιῑξιῖε] The chorus is to atter sentiments showing favor

The business of the chorus was to utter such reflectione as any indifferent
persons might conceive on the action before it, and to address those reflec-
tions to the characters represented, as one might address them to real persons
under the same circumstances.

198. mensae brevis] Compare Epp. i. 14. 35, “ coena brevis juvat '’ 3 and
with “apertis otia portiS,'' compare C. iii. 5. 23, “portaeque non clausas‚’'

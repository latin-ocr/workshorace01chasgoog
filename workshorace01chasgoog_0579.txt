ba of Baiae by a narrow causeway, the construction of which tradition at-
tributod to Hercules. Beyond the Lucrinus lay the, Avernus lacus ssago
d’Averno)‚ a basin without any outlet, about a mile and a half in circum-
ference, and fed by streame from Mons Gaurus (Monte Barbare). The space
between the two lakes was covered with wood. In the war with Sextus
Pompeius, B. c. 37, Augustae, advised by Agrippa, to whom he had en·
trusted the task of reforming his ficet, opened a communication between the
lakes, and between lacus Avernus and the sea, whereby he made a harbor
in whieh he was able to raetise his ships. This he called ‘ portus Julius?
This is the work Virgil assudes to (Georg. ii. 16} ). ⁵ The basin of the Luci-ine
lake has been filled up by the rising of a volcamc lull (Monte Naum), and h

and Plutarch (Gaea. 58). That Augustus may ‘have contemplated it like-

his mind, is ossible. The canal extended from Forum Appii to erracina,
which is sai to have been the length of the marshes at that time. Horace
appears to be speculatiug upon a work which, though often attempted, has

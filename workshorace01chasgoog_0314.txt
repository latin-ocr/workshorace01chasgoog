should write one in prose. It does not follow that Maecenas ever wrote, or
that Horace ever seriously intended ιο advise his writing. ‘ Pedestribus ’ is
an adaptation of the Greek πεζὸς λόγος for ‘ prose‚' or ‘ soluta oratic,' which
latter was the usual expression for prose in Horace’s time. He uses the word
‘ pedester' again twice to express a plain style of speech, but not for prose
as opposed ιο poc (S. ii. 6. 17, and A. P. 95). Quintilian uses the word,
but expressly as a recism. The word ‘prosa’ or ‘prorsa,' as its correct
form appears ιο be, is of later use than the age of Augustus.

noticed in . i. 2. 49. See also . iv. 2. 35, n. Epod. vii. 7. ,

12. Reyum colla minacium] The same as ‘reges minaces! Their necks
are mentioned in allusion ιο their humbled pride.

13. dominae] If by Licymnia is meant Terentia (see Introduction),
‘dominae ' may stand for wife, as in Virg. (Aen. vi. 397) : “ Hi Dius
dominam thalamo deducere adorti.''

14. luctuum Fulyentes] The neuter adjective pei-forms in this and like cases
the office of an adverb, which is very common in all languages.

The dances at her festival were led by ladies of rank (see C. iv. 6. 31. . P.
232). ‘ Choris ’ appear ιο be private, as opposed ιο the sacred dances.
Dancing was not unusual in private society at this time, even among iadice-
Therefore it was not degrading to Terentia, who was probably fond of this
amusement. Other words used with ‘ brachia,’ ιο express dancing, are
⁴ jactare,’ ‘ deducere,’ ‘ ducere,’ ‘mittere,’ ‘ movere? The gmccful motion
of the arms seems to have been one of the chief attractions in dancing, as it
is still, wherever it is practised as an art. · ·

The expression ‘ferre pedem ’ is used by Virgil (Georg. i. 11), and ‘lu-
dere’ (Ec. vi. 27). ‘Dianae celebris die is the day on which the temple
of Diana was crowded with worshippers. ‘ Celebris' and ‘creber' are the
same word under different forms. ,

ODE XIII.

I‘r is impossible ιο sa with certainty when the accident happened which is
referred ιο in this Ode, ut there are reasons for supposing it was when Hor-
ace was about forty years old, B. c. 25 or 26. It appears that a tree on his
farm fell and nearly struck him. In this Ode he describes the danger he had

At the end of the building was a part called ‘ tribunal,' devoted to law.

58. vel porco vel bove] The animala most commonly sacrifieed by the Ro-
mans were sheep, pigs, and oxen. On public occasions these three were sae-
rificed together, and the sacrifice was called ‘ suovetaurilia,’ being a combina-
tion of the three names. Private persons would only sacrifice the three on
great occasions, aud on some there would be several of each or any of them
offered together. Ordinarily they sacrificed but one, according to their
means or their zeal.

59. Jane pater Ι] See S. ii. 6. 20, n. Silent devotion was not practised or
understood by the ancients, any more than it is by the heathen or Mahome-

tans now: μετὰ φωνῆς εὔχεσθαι δεῖ is reported to have been a saying of
Pythagoras. Silent prayers were supposed to be a veil either for improper
petitione, or magical incantations, or something wrong. To speak with rnen
as if the gods were listening, and with the gods so as men might overhear, is
a rule found in more than one writer.

thether this is referred to by Horace, or whether any such practice existe , ·
is doubtful. It is very likely Horace means no more than a man stooping to
pick up an as from the mud.

swallowed up in love of it, has east away his arms, and run away from the' .
ranks of virtue. If you catch him, do not put him to death, but sell him sor,
a slave, which is all he is fit for. He may do good service in keeping cattle,¹-

ωῗξπῖἵὲἓιῖσεὲοὲηι possis] One of the principal sources from which the 1³⁰⁵<
mans got their slaves, in earlier timeS, was the risoners of war. Dcalers
always aceom ied the camp for the purpose o purchasing them. They2
were sold on t e spot by auction, ‘ sub corona,' that is, with a ehaplet on theu·¹
head to mark them for sale. See Caesar (B. G. iii. 16). Captives reserved¹
to follow the triumph of the commander were put to death when the proces·-
sion was over (see Epod. 7. 8, n.). The law-writers derive ‘servus’ from
‘ servare,’ as prisoners kept for slavery were not put to death. ‘Annona'1
properly signifies the year's supply of provisions from the harvest. ‘ Penus ’
signifies provisions of all sorts3 here it means all sorts of imported provisions,

come to his country, giving himself out to be Dionysus, and has tempted all
the women to go out and do honor to him, sends his servants to ap rehend
him. The god allows himself to be taken, and, when brought be ore the
king, describes himself as the servant of Dionysus. Then follows a dialogus,
of which the verses above referred to form part. The application is obvious.

he wishes he ean eall death to his assistance, — a bad doctrine for good mer*

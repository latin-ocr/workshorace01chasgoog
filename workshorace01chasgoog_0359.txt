4. mare Apula-um] fi'ehJs would apply to the hay on which Tarentum is

mffil? ae‘ctq'liura placet] The-habits of the Sue'vi, Ι113 described by caesar
(Bell. Gall. iv. 1), are here assigned to the Getae, who are included with the
Scythiam. “ They had 100 districts (‘ pagi '),'' says 116, “ 66611 of which sup·
plied annually 1,000 soldierS, who served a year and were then relieved by
others, who in their turn served a year and were relieved. Those who stayed

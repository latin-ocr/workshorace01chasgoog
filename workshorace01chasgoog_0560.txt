with Homer and Virgil in all the schools. See Juvenal (vii. 226) ε ·
“ Quot stabant pueri, eum totus decolor esset
Flaccus, et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.''

19. Cum tibi sol tepidus] In the heat of the day, and before dinner in the
hams, people read to themselves or one another. It is not easy to see the
connection of this line with what goes before. It is something of a conta-ar·
diction. But he supposes the book may perhaps be popular for a time.

20. Me, libertino natum patre] Compare S. i. 6. 6, 46, 47.

35, and S. ii. 1. 75. e does not mind at this time referring to his old gen-
erals, Brutus and Cassius. The description he gives of himself corresponds
with that we find in his biographer. See also C. ii. 11. 15. Epp..i. 4. 15.

28. Colleyum Lepidum] Horace was born on the eth of December, B. c. 65,
in the year of the consulship of L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta.
He completed his forty-fourth year, therefore, in December, Β. c. 21. In that
year M. Lollius (to whom C. iv. 9 is addressed) and Q. AEmilius Lepidus
were consuls. ‘ Duxit’ merely means that he had Lepidus for his colleague.
Why Horace should be so particular in letting the world know his present

in the above year I cannot tell. He was in a communicative mood

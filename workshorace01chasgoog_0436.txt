carried on between the two rivals (Caesar being at Rome) through agents

Horace started from Rome with onl one companion, Heliodorus the rhet-

about fi -six miles, till they reached Tarracina or Anxur, where, b appoint-

It is probable that, before Horace returned to Rome, he visited Tarentum
and his native place, Venusia, through which he would naturally pass. He

pena, between Mons Aventinus and Mons Caelius in the southern quarter of
the city. Aricia (La Riccia), one of the most ancient towns of Latium, was
sixteen miles from¹ Rome. It was situated on the side of a hill, sloping down
to a valley called Vallis Aricina, through which the Appia ‘Via passed. This
part of the road is still in good preservation. The citadel was placed on the
top of the hill (Sti-abe, v. p. 239), and on that spot stands the modern town.
Aricia was a considerable town in Horace’s time, and for some centuries
after. Cicero calls it “municipium--vetustate antiquissimum, splendore
municipum honestissimum ” (Phil. iii. ὂ). Its neighborhood to Rome, and
accessible position, contributed to its prosper-ity, which was assisted by its
association with the worshi of Diana Aricina, who had a temple among the
woods on the small lake ( acus Nemorensis), a short way from the town,
probably on the site of the modern town Nemi. The wealthy Romans had
villas in the neighborhood. ,

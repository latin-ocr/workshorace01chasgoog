31. Virttaeem verta putas] Comp. “Aut virtus nomen mane est,” etc.
Epp. 17. 41). ‘Lucus ’ is usually a grove dedicated to some divinity, and
orace may mean that the man had no regard for what others held sacred,
but counted a consecrated grove no better than any other wood. Or, since
‘lucus ’ was sometimes used indifferenti for any wood, Horace may mean,
‘if you think virtue consists only of wo s, as a grove does of trees!

33. Ne Cibyratica,] ‘ Cibyra Major’ was situated on a branch of the In-
dus, ou the northwest borders of Lycia. It was called ‘ major,' to distinguish
it from a smaller town on the coast of Pamphylia. Twenty-five towns be-
lon ed to the conventus of Cibyra, and its commercial transactious were
proffiably large. As to ‘Bithyna negotia,’ see C. iii. 7. 3, n. ‘Negotia’ is
commonly used for the business transactions of a ‘ negociator,’ as Cicero, in
his letter introducing Manlius Sosis to Acilius, proconsul of Sicil (Ad Fam.
xiii. 20), says», “ habet negotia vetera in Sicilia sua.” He had ebts to get
in, and accounts of old standing to settle.

34. Mille talenta mundentur On ‘ talenta,' see S. ii. 7. 89, n. ‘ Rotundo ’
is not used iu this sense elsew erc. The meaning is the same as ours when
we talk of a round number: it is a complete number, leaving out fractions.
‘ Porro ’ means ‘ farther! ‘ Quadrat acervum,’ ‘makes the fourth side of the
square,’ as it were. Iu the next verse ‘ fidem ’ signifies ‘ credit!

3⁷. reyina Pecunia] ‘ Pecunia ³ is here personitied and made a royal lady,

and Juvenal apostrophizes her thus:
“ Funesta Pecunia, templo

Nondum habitas, nullas nummorum ereximus aras. ' (i. 113.)
Horace here repeats in effect what he saidnip) S. ii. 3·.94²

38. Suadela Venusque] ‘ Suadela ' is another form of Suada, who repre-
sented the Greek divinity Πειθώ, Persuasion. The name, Cicero tells us,
was Latinized by Ennius (Brut. 15). Πειθώ was usually associated with
Ἀφροδίτη, and their statues stood together at Athens, where it is pretty cer-
tain Horace must have seen them. Ι cannot find that Suada had any temple
or separate worship at Rome. She was supposed to assist Venus in resid—
ing at marriages‚ and she, the Graces, and Mercury were the acknowl'edged
companions of that goddess. Therefere Horace associates them here. Cicero
tells us (Cat. Magi. xiv. 50) that Ennius called the eloquent M. Cethegus
“ Suadae medullam‚” ‘ the marrow of persuasion.' (See Epp. ii. 2. 117, ιι.)

39. Mancipiis locuples] See S. ii. 7. 3, n. Cappadocia was governed by

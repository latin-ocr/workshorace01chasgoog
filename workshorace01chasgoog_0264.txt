2. machinae] The machines here mentioned axe called by Caesar (B. C.
ii. 10) ‘ phalangae? They were rollers. Vessels were drawn up on shore
from the Ides of November to the Ides of March, during which time “De-
fendens pisces hiemat mare '’ (S. ii. 2. 17). As to ‘ Favonius ’ see C. iii. 7. 2.
The usual word for ‘ to launeh ’ (for which ⁸ trahunt ' is here used) is ‘ dedu-
cere‚’ the reverse of which, ‘ to haul up on shore,’ is ‘ subducere?

3. neque—aut—nec] The two first of these form one branch of the sen-
tence, and the last the other. “ Neque (pecus aut arator) gaudet nec prata
albicantlJ See-C. 11. 3, at the beginning.

g: ixnibgnmcnfflmaffihq &afflasti-hogtmoen overhead.’ ‘ Cytherea 'Venus ⁹ is

unusual, but is analogous to Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων.

6. June-tneque Nymphis] ‘ Nymphis ’ is dative. Translate ‘ decentes ’
‘comely.’ See C. 30. 5, and 7, 11.

7. qraves] This epithet may have* a varie of meanings. Perhaps Hor-
ace meant ‘ laborious.' The eruptions of tna, where the thunderbolts
of Jove were supposed to be forged, taking place chiefly in the summer
and early autumn, the Cyclops are fitly represented as preparing these bolts
1118ΒΡ ῗὲῗ] This seems to be an adaptation of φλέγει, ‘ lights up,’ and is an
unusual sense for ‘ uro.² Ovid (Fast. iv. 473) has “ Antraque Cyelopum,
positis exusta caminiS,’' which was possibly imitated from this. ·

9. nitidum] i. e. with oil. C. ii. 7. 22, n. ; Epp. i. 5. 14, n.

ll. Fauno decet immolare] The Faunalia took place on the Ides of De·
camber. But a lesser festival was observed on the Ides of February, at the
advent of Faunus (Pan, the two being identified by the later Romans).
See C. iii. 18. At that time the flocks and herds went out to gtaze, and the
god was invoked for their protection. ‘ Immolare ’ admits of two construc-
tions: with an ablative, as (Livy xli. 14) “immolantibus Jovi singulis
bubus ”5 and with an accusative, as (Virg. Aen. x. 519) “inferias uas
immolet umbris.'' Horace himself has the latter construction elsew ere
(S. ii. :f3.164): “lgmffnolet- aequis hie porcum Laribus.” So Virgil (Ecl. iii.

“ acias vi .'
{73’33pulsatl t(ukrid, Hei-oid. xxi. 46, “Persephone nostras pulsat acerba
ores.

14. Reqes] This word is commonly applied to the rich by Horace, and
by Terence too, as Phormio (i. 2. 20) z “ O ! regem me esse opportuit.” The
Romam, after the expulsion of the kingS, used the terms ‘rex,’ ‘ regnum‚’
‘ regnare,' for the most part, in an invidious sense.- ‘ Beatus ' means one
who is rich and lives free from missortunes. Sestius shared the defeat of
Brutus gg Phililplpi, but returning to Rome he was favored by Augustus, and
rose to cons . “

15. inchoare] ‘ To enter upon.' This word means properly to begin a
thing and not to bring it to an end. The derivation is uncertain.

16. premet} From this word, which belongs more properly to ‘ noX,’ we
must understand appropriate words for ‘ Manes ' and ‘ domus? Orelli snp-
plies ‘ circumvolitabant ’ and ‘ teget.'

fabulaeque Manes] This is explained by J uv. S. ii. 149 :—

“ Esse aliquid (or aliquos) Manes —
Nec pueri credunt nisi qui nondum aere lavantur.”
Persicus has imitated Horace, S. v. 152: “ cinis et Manes et fabula fies.”

,υ ‘ Fabulae,' therefore, signifies ‘ unreal.’ See Epp. ii. 2. 209, n. ·-- ‘ Exilis ’ is
‘ bare‚’ as in Epp. i. 6. 45 ε “ Exilis domus est qua non et multa supersunt.” .

-— ‘ Simul' is used commonly by Horace for ‘ simul ac‚' ‘ as soo'n 1133-

‘ Mirabere,’ as expressing affection, savors of the Greek θαυμάζειν. It occurs
again Epod. iii. 10. —As to ‘talis,' ‘ diee‚' see S. ii. 3. 171, n. It was usual

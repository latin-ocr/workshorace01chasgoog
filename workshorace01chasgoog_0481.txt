466 sores.
Greek expression. ,

127. perjuras,] ‘ Pejerare ' is the common form of this word.

129. servosque taos quos aere parada] ‘ Quos aere pararis ² shows the folly
of the man who, having laid out his money in the purchase of slaves, em·
ploys himself in breaking their heads with stones. Such a man, says Sterti-
nius, would be counted mad by acclamation. ‘ Well, then,' he adds to the
miser, ‘ are yon not mad, who poison your mother or strangle your wife, to ³

and when no one suspected itt} ' As to ‘ quid enim,' see note on S. i. l. 7. κ

130. pueri clamantque puellae .·] “ ‘ Que in the poets is sometimes placed,
not after the second of the two words compared, but after a word which is
the common predicate of both clauses.'' (Key's L. G. 1441.) In a note, Pro-
fessor Key adds, “ A construction that probably began with a repetition of
the predicate, ‘pueri clament clamentque puellae-³ ” See below (v. 157),
“ furtis pereamque rapinis,’' and many other instances.

137. male tutae mentis] ‘Tutus' was in medical language equivalent to
‘ sanus! ‘ Incolumis ' is used in the same sense (v. 132).

141. Hanc Furiam, hunc aliud] What Horace alludes to when he speaks
of Orestes calling Pylades names, is uncertain. In the Orestes of Euripides
(v. 264) he says to his sister:

μέθες· μί’ οὖσα τῶν ἐμῶν ἕρινῦων
μέσον μ’ ὀχμάζεις, ὡς βάλῃς ἐς Τά αρον.

splendida bilia] ‘ Splendida' is a redundant epit et. Persius, who imi-
tates Horace frequently, calls it ‘ vitrea bilis ’ (iii. 8). Galen says, “ The blsck
bile is brighter than the blood itself, like the asphalt from the Dead Sea,
which they call Jewish asphalt.'’
’ 142. Opimius] This man, who was ‘magnas inter opes inops '‘ (C. iii. 16.
28) is quite unknown except from this description. On the wine of Veii see
note on C. i. 9. 7, and Persius ( S. v. 147) : ‘⁴ Veientanumque rubellum.”
On ‘ Campana trulla,' see S. i. 6. 118. ‘ Trulla,’ which has the same ele· ἶ

ment as τρύβλιον, was a drinking-cup of some shape. It was not necessarily
of carmen-ware, as here. Cicero (in Verr. ii. 4. 27) mentions one made of a

The wretched man, when he hears the price of his food, conjures up the no-
tion that everybody is conspiring to rob and plunder him. .

158. Quisnam iyitm'· tanus 7] These questions and answers are all carried
on b Stertinius himself. ‘ Stultus et insanus ' means ‘he is a fool, and
there ore mad ' ; not ‘ he is a fool, and moreovcr he is mad‚' since folly and
madness have already been declared to be identical.

ι 161. Craterum dixisse utato] Craterus was an eminent physician of that
day. Cicero speaks of {im with confidence as attending the daughter of At-
ticus during her illness, Β. c. 45„ He is mentioned by Persius many years
afterwards as representing the profession (S. iii. 65). ‘ Cardiacus,' according ,
to Celsus's definition‚ is “ nothing else than excessivo weakness of the body,
which, frp’m the stomach having lost its tone, is wasted with immoderate
